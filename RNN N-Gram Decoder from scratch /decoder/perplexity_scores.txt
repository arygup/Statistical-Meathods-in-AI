the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and	362.2707
she wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to	1257.1409
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary	761.2949
what is that	34.1748
bonacieux	1279.8103
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has	241.6049
is that what you would	44.9999
he has some but he is very avaricious that is his	202.3997
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find	310.3968
and i have none either said the	286.8088
those who have read the memoirs of	699.4521
de motteville will not be astonished at this	704.0544
but wait a	458.9199
anne of austria ran to her jewel	1706.0166
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been	339.4654
it came from my brother the king of	291.9380
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of	190.1852
take this ring raise money with it and let your husband set	851.8734
in an hour you shall be	224.1274
you see the address said the queen speaking so low that	582.9356
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham	709.3484
the letter shall be given to	352.6537
generous	9243.9922
cried anne of	12.3985
ten minutes afterward she was at	697.1891
she found	72.7825
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her masters	383.1544
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to	839.0735
this was the more so because bonacieuxs reflections were all	1253.3950
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	972.5806
on her side	426.1734
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from	2479.2681
married at eighteen to	502.1193
there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twentythree years old and	836.5499
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of	536.9633
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open	1408.6199
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to	795.1397
let us talk a little said	300.3460
said bonacieux	1655.5082
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell	327.9151
true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to	260.5363
describe to me your abduction i pray	130.4844
oh thats of no consequence just now said	680.9705
and what does it concern thenmy	5361.6934
you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in	640.1359
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the	311.3870
oh a day and night soon pass	286.7861
let us return to the object that brings me	310.9525
what that which brings you home to	217.9668
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a	441.4122
asked the mercer piqued to the	738.1369
yes that first and other things	719.8208
it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps	969.4127
yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give	177.9974
yes	98.4007
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same	536.1407
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak	689.3752
much money to be	456.2331
said bonacieux protruding his	424.0988
yes	1231.8361
about how	57.7792
a thousand pistoles	121.2199
what you demand of me is serious	230.9955
it is	91.3650
what must be	19.4634
you must go away	1023.5880
and whither am i to	243.0044
to	5116.2715
i go to	153.6358
go	130.9685
you	46809.6797
i have no business in	207.1868
but others wish that you should go	277.5587
but who are those	50.8654
an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits	603.1020
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise	2128.7688
more	3883116.7500
nothing but	4623.8940
thank you madame i am aware of them now monsieur cardinal has enlightened me on that	334.7773
the	1250.8290
cried	325.5350
have you seen the	129.6519
he sent for me answered the mercer	679.5063
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent	1206.8822
he illtreated you then he threatened	1278.3843
he gave me his hand and called me his	104.7069
his	1299.7715
do you hear that	61.9873
i am the friend of the great	122.4905
of the great	116.2641
perhaps you would contest his right to that title	652.9419
you serve the	176.1287
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the	1246.1567
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are	313.2512
cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your	909.1369
private interests are as nothing before the interests of	413.5005
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux	1337.7964
and what do you know about the state you talk	129.6505
said	325.5350
bonacieux shrugging her	21.5193
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most	1803.9236
eh	5846.0977
whence comes that	95.5537
you do not	113.4157
from the	16.0743
from him and from my friend the comte de	245.0820
the comte de	21.0405
why it was he who carried me	142.6658
that may be	45.3637
and you receive silver from that	1031.6156
have you not said that that abduction was entirely	488.7239
madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well	906.1377
i say you are a miserable	367.1273
continued	325.5350
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her	1245.9352
you meddle with politics do youand still more with cardinalist	6589.1802
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for	517.6666
no to the	34.2536
its the same thing cried the young	199.2263
who calls richelieu calls	11330.2969
hold your tongue hold your tongue	394.5566
you may be	352.8615
yes you are right i should be ashamed for anyone to know your	541.8631
but what do you require of me	53.0474
let us	50.7984
i have told	12.4701
you must depart instantly	2143.3022
bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his	628.4598
he was	2515.4736
a man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of	1722.5212
bonacieux saw that he	250.1304
have you	163.2084
said	437.7391
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of	353.8372
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without	479.6852
what matters it if you avoid	584.5721
hold madame bonacieux said the mercer	931.6467
i positively refuse intrigues terrify	185007.8906
i have seen the	507.7400
thats a frightful place that	926.4966
only to think of it makes my flesh	1639.4886
they threatened me with	1473.4403
do you know what torture	286.5796
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick	7777.1655
no positively i will not	195.5610
and morbleu why do you not go	531.8026
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in	288.7755
i really believe you are a man and a violent one	253.3194
and you you are a womana miserable woman stupid and	1260.9675
you are afraid are	26.0725
bonacieux fell into a profound	574.4623
have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and ii will appeal to his	515.8289
at once	703.5843
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so	566.3987
well be it	31.0639
said	437.7391
perhaps when all is considered you are	402.4846
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust	1873.9965
well i will give it up then said the young woman	173.3564
it is well as it is say no more about	131.4258
it was about one of those purchases that interest womena purchase by which much might have been	2082.3721
thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied	313.1350
i shall return very safely to the louvre all	1015.3880
as you please madame bonacieux said the	922.0510
shall i see you again	62.2150
very well i shall expect	70.7155
you are not angry with	127.9461
not the least in the	54.2736
till then	14.9855
till	76.0789
bonacieux kissed his wifes hand and set off at a quick	1299.4679
well said	47.4232
and i who have answered for him to the queeni who have promised my poor mistressah my god my	685.3035
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than	509.7146
i hate you and on my word you shall pay for	214.3187
chapter	2041.6486
you have then overheard our	378.8304
asked	325.5350
bonacieux eagerly and looking at dartagnan with	511.0573
the	109103.8750
but how my	124.8059
and what did you understand by what we	68.4258
a thousand	1284.3997
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i	424.2399
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her	601.9820
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to	351.5792
my love for	46.5249
what is to be	24.7542
my god my	6.5207
murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you	337.9887
you are almost a	222.2825
i see that you require someone to answer for	204.1723
i admit that would reassure me	1620.5355
do you know	26.3948
who are these	165.2101
three of the kings	77.6591
do you know monsieur de trville their	362.1840
oh yes	175.6205
you do not fear lest he should betray you to the	196.6423
oh no certainly	581.8837
but this secret is not mine and i cannot reveal it in this	330.3921
you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan with	1027.2743
and yet meyou see plainly that i love	657.2141
you say	23.3072
i am an honorable	716.6075
you say	23.3072
i am a gallant	1193.7161
i believe	22.3115
i am	336.7779
oh i am sure of	38.1262
then put me to the	155.4489
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of	2337.1248
listen said she i yield to your protestations i yield to your	1276.3115
this was their mutual declaration of	2597.6682
dartagnan was radiant with joy and	322.3326
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he	601.1240
confidence and love made him a	351.5044
i go said he i go at	62.2963
how you will	23.7824
said	325.5350
bonacieux and your regiment your	632.9423
by my soul you had made me forget all that dear	506.8363
yes you are right a furlough is	2043.6843
still another obstacle murmured	11224.8760
bonacieux	60855.0820
as to that cried dartagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be	651.7751
how	36.7079
but another	457.0765
asked dartagnan seeing that	237.9504
bonacieux hesitated to	2372.4272
you have perhaps no	115.9933
perhaps is too much said dartagnan	195.7443
then replied	103.2450
the	33402.2930
the cardinals replied	575.8671
you see it makes a very respectable	834.3346
pardieu cried dartagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinals	621.3893
you are an amiable and charming young man said	627.6171
be assured you will not find her majesty	316.1807
oh i am already grandly	11434.8330
cried	20.7309
said	325.5350
bonacieux	1169416.3750
someone is talking in the	476.8014
it is the voice of of my	92.6087
yes i recognize	35.9529
dartagnan ran to the door and pushed the	112.6875
but i ought to be gone	267.0201
and the disappearance of his money how am i to justify it if i am	407.1243
you are right we must go	90.4169
go	3509.7146
he will see us if we go	56.6038
then you must come up into my	171.2540
ah said	47.4232
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens	431.5168
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her	213.3340
dartagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her	2468.9900
with me you will be as safe as in a temple i give you my word of a	204.6877
let us go said she i place full confidence in you my	416.3658
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the	871.3701
at sight of this man dartagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the	537.0555
it was the man of	108.7859
what are you going to	21.0842
cried	325.5350
bonacieux you will ruin us	71.6796
but i have sworn to kill that	298.3517
said	20.7309
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to	392.3862
and do you command nothing in your own	201.5435
in my name said	385.1873
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg	250.2191
but listen they appear to be speaking of	226.3934
dartagnan drew near the window and lent his	988.1183
she is gone said he she must have returned to the	147.1634
you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went	386.9136
no replied bonacieux with a selfsufficient air she is too superficial a	1272.8789
is the young guardsman at	1458.1809
all the same it is well to be	141.6429
how	36.7079
by knocking at his	175.3402
i will ask his	335.7533
no one	109.5332
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed	1082.5364
as to dartagnan he took care not to give the least sign of	414.3255
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within	827.7059
there is nobody within said	656.4133
never	81669.0625
let us return to your	336.5634
we shall be safer there than in the	1008.6629
ah my	21.0990
whispered	325.5350
bonacieux we shall hear no	190.3585
on the contrary said dartagnan we shall hear	261.1154
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	651.2625
you are sure there is nobody	385.3164
said the	36.8983
i will answer for it said	118.6894
and you think that your wife has returned to the	207.3317
without speaking to anyone but	189.4885
i am sure of	61.7679
that is an important point do you	285.9005
then the news i brought you is of	248.0806
the greatest my dear bonacieux i dont conceal this from	284.0082
then the cardinal will be pleased with	125.4541
i have no doubt of	43.4849
the great	199.5589
are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no	487.0185
i think	32.3051
she did not name madame de chevreuse the duke of buckingham or madame de	1051.6489
no she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious	672.7103
the	5707.1611
murmured	325.5350
said dartagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to	393.5257
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the	402.5977
you would then be in present possession of the	191.9353
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and	313.1674
well youthe cardinal would have given you letters of	632.8229
did he tell you	107.5883
yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable	496.0369
be satisfied replied bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet	1390.8885
the	73198.5234
murmured	325.5350
said dartagnan pressing her hand more	1247.7455
how is there still	156.3046
asked the man in the	72.4631
i go to the louvre i ask for	389.0617
well go	93.1850
i will return soon to learn the result of your	677.2892
the stranger went	87.4556
said	325.5350
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her	3665.7947
said dartagnan pressing her hand still more	996.8370
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of dartagnan and	4809.0522
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying	975.7407
oh my	21.0990
cried	325.5350
bonacieux he will rouse the whole	915.9624
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said	195.3334
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the	423.7494
to her and to	67.5251
cried	20.7309
be satisfied beautiful	24673.8105
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your	631.5670
the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	2039.1334
chapter	48.4451
plan of campaign dartagnan went straight to	178.9171
de	863.2876
the heart of the young man overflowed with	342.4715
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of	368.8793
de trville was in his saloon with his habitual court of	1087.9310
dartagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when	634.5869
de trville	351.1856
all the way along dartagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in	737.4523
de trville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret	1877.7256
but	30.2698
did you ask for me my good	124.0781
said	30.2698
de	257.5922
speak then i am all	131.2925
it concerns nothing less said dartagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the	420.7043
what did you	11.9604
asked	30.2698
de trville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon	1328.3937
is this secret your	396.6670
no monsieur it is her	242.3190
are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to	254.1572
no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest	727.2329
why then are you about to betray it to	116.5029
keep your secret young man and tell me what you	189.0979
i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen	459.6862
this very	280.8871
you leave	123.7273
i am going on a	219.1734
may you tell me	192.7624
to	5116.2715
has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival	1009.7529
the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my	422.8537
and you are going	22.8946
i am going	111.8858
in that case you will not get beyond	1842.4856
i tell you so by the faith of de	366.0396
how	36.7079
you will be	332.2861
and i shall die in the performance of my	125.1338
but your mission will not be	313.4653
that is true replied	45.8489
believe me continued trville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set	992.0974
without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to	285.6032
we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all	3528.8621
sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that i authorize their	1151.0458
thanks	185.0368
you are a hundred times too	183.5428
begone then find them instantly and let all be done	257.6973
but first write your request to	2449.6628
dartagnan drew up his request and	316.3149
have the goodness to send mine to athoss	1276.5032
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go	1794.0277
be	15037.0693
adieu and a prosperous	1852.8580
a propos said	390.0349
de trville calling him	384.6211
dartagnan	962.8327
have you any	178.4718
dartagnan tapped the bag he had in his	329.1117
asked	30.2698
de	257.5922
three hundred	20.3811
oh	3340637.7500
that would carry you to the end of the	108.7906
begone	76.0789
dartagnan saluted	23.9091
de trville who held out his hand to him dartagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with	419.1111
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and	1057.2375
dartagnan asked some questions about this prolonged	4210.1997
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of	7190.6582
augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good	853.9928
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from	408.7150
de trville entered bringing a sealed	1931.0077
what is	11.7476
asked	79.6394
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the	759.6456
for	130.0698
i have asked for no leave of	239.8566
hold your tongue and take	148.4193
said	20.7309
the lackey bowed to the ground and	419.6616
what does all this	484.1704
asked	79.6394
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow	252.1934
but i cannot leave paris just now without knowing aramis	1174.3845
what is become of	202.4925
i suppose you mean continued	242.3395
become of	77.4839
replied	79.6394
the woman who was herethe woman with the embroidered	2869.8040
who told you there was a woman	198.0230
replied aramis becoming as pale as	417.1649
i saw	104.9963
and you know who she	205.2328
i believe i can guess at	454.6875
said	79.6394
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that	210.0487
i presume that she has returned to	388.5489
to	333813.9062
yes that may	26.0048
you evidently know	306.9928
but why did she return to tours without telling me	1354.0579
because she was in fear of being	404.6018
why has she not written to me	186.0800
because she was afraid of compromising	545.4174
dartagnan you restore me to	163.5753
cried	79.6394
i fancied myself despised	19761.9727
i was so delighted to see her	169.3988
for the cause which today takes us to	287.5557
and what is this	62.1769
demanded	79.6394
oh youll know it someday aramis but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctors	2574.0400
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain	956.3353
a propos inform	151738.1562
will bazin go with	832.4641
asked	79.6394
perhaps	36.7080
at all events it is best that he should follow us to	509.1887
said	71.5366
to nobody in the	451.9222
not even to athos or	234.8823
i have not breathed a syllable to	841.4747
good	1988.2863
tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with dartagnan and both soon arrived at athoss	1099.3965
they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and	249.8614
de trvilles note in the	489.4126
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just	274.1145
said the astonished	218.4800
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a	981.8950
yours affectionate de trville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me	428.1369
to the waters of	28893.9375
there or	268.9433
in the kings	176.5145
either the kings or the	164.9394
are we not their majesties	2270.9475
at that moment porthos	1583.9602
said he here is a strange	122.1843
since when i wonder in the musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for	637.7226
since said dartagnan they have friends who ask it for	299.9306
ah	213.9960
said porthos it appears theres something fresh	705.0593
yes we are going said	57.4848
to what	63.4270
demanded	24.6358
my	285.7933
i dont know much about it said	130.5060
ask	20.7309
to london gentlemen said	341.6406
to	5116.2715
cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in	144.7949
that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to	215.5642
but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have	443.1016
nor i said	29.2524
nor i said	26.9833
i have replied dartagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the	643.4072
there are in this bag three hundred	437.1771
let each take seventyfive that is enough to take us to london and	948.2471
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at	680.1113
why	36.7080
because in all probability some one of us will be left on the	232.1118
is this then a campaign upon which we are now	659.3238
one of a most dangerous kind i give you	478.7855
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what	456.6186
you would be all the wiser said	269.9765
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthoss	700.7323
is the king accustomed to give you such	735.4015
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about	679.0849
so let us go and get killed where we are told to	550.5369
is life worth the trouble of so many	2094.5764
dartagnan i am ready to follow	72.1952
and i also said	75.5554
and i also said	80.1663
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris i had need of	785.6718
well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said	729.9824
and now when are we to	127.4550
asked	36.8714
immediately replied dartagnan we have not a minute to	235.9116
hello	321.0379
cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the	1924.7465
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full	656.4822
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said	762.3727
where do we go	151.1336
to calais said dartagnan that is the most direct line to	754.2504
well said porthos this is my advice	160.1065
four men traveling together would be	1771.0640
dartagnan will give each of us his	393.8658
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by	1318.6967
i am the bearer of a letter that is	122.8501
i have not and i cannot make three copies of that letter because it is	402.0695
we must then as it appears to me travel in	324.8659
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the	428.5501
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do	1154.7213
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men whereas four men together make a	1569.6002
well said cried aramis you dont often speak athos but when you do speak it is like	356.1644
john of the golden	194.6854
i agree to athoss	8949.3105
and you	53.4515
i agree to it too said porthos if dartagnan approves of	648.0368
well said dartagnan i decide that we should adopt athoss plan and that we set off in half an	803.9871
shouted the three musketeers in	247.4584
chapter	117.9150
the journey at two oclock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrire	1298.0138
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety	6055.0430
besides the appearance of the caravan was	1562.3192
the lackeys followed armed to the	1233.9918
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight oclock in the	376.3182
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing	2242.4233
martin giving half his cloak to a poor	544.2900
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again	1041.2684
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at	496.3030
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was	633.0576
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers	1956.7366
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his	973.4301
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the	352.3063
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his	513.9566
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his	731.9169
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it cant be helped there is no drawing	733.3415
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you	382.4408
there goes	44.6936
cried athos at the end of five hundred	234.1610
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of	599.9454
asked	79.6394
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said	424.7919
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for	1236.3566
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their	554.3228
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather	34029.2461
athos wished to restrain him but it was too	706.5956
it was an	723.0242
shouted	20.7309
dont waste a	6749.2930
aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the	451.8442
mousquetons horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his	373.9695
that will serve us for a relay said	1666.8058
i would rather have had a hat said	182.7565
mine was carried away by a	452.6823
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in	204.3391
theyll kill poor porthos when he comes up said	511.5466
if porthos were on his legs he would have rejoined us by this time said	491.8006
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	570.0272
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his	803.2246
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and	508.4309
i wont be their dupe i will answer for	418.3896
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and	2064.6858
i swear by dont waste time in swearing said dartagnan let us gallop if our horses will	1900.4430
and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their	20538.5605
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden	3096.1191
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on	508.7979
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the	1860.3770
dartagnan and athos refused	302.5484
the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they	754.4885
it was indeed planchet and	151.4562
grimaud can take care of the horses said	223.8287
and on what will you	80.3308
said	20.7309
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of	2528.7410
come then said dartagnan you are	72.8280
mine hosts face does not please me at all it is too	627.5040
nor me either said	269.3003
the night was quiet	562.7665
somebody replied that he was mistaken and went	238.0350
at four oclock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the	680.1547
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten	2032.0256
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used	390.2924
this began to be	723.2573
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a	922.2053
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully	2301.1104
these would just have suited	387.0001
athos went down to pay the reckoning while dartagnan and planchet stood at the street	511.6732
the host was in a lower and back room to which athos was requested to	420.7065
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the	590.8038
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly	739.2567
you	500686304.0000
cried athos going toward him ill cut your ears	889.9446
at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon	549.1984
i am	181.2691
shouted athos with all the power of his	236.9599
go on	49.2700
spur	1302812.7500
and he fired two	334.9132
do you know what has become of	86.9846
asked dartagnan of planchet as they galloped	682.9343
brave	36.8714
forward planchet	71.4383
you are a brave	100.7692
as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being	1308.8613
besides i am here in my own country and that excites	540.5106
and both with free use of the spur arrived at	817.5454
omer without drawing	140733.2969
at	841.0684
there still remained planchets horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a	662.8740
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great	394.4417
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to	1070.3091
i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it	392.0107
have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the	745.7482
where shall i find the	97.9575
at his country	536.8580
and that is	431.4199
at a quarter of a league from the	184.4317
look you may see it from hereat the foot of that little hill that slated	3174.9961
very well said the	140.1564
and with his lackey he took the road to the governors country	382.5695
dartagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred	443.5544
once outside the city dartagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little	878.7216
monsieur you appear to be in great	432.4712
no one can be more so	151.5717
to let me sail	293.0154
very sorry monsieur but i was here first and will not sail	482.2821
i am sorry too monsieur but i arrived second and must sail	743.0346
the kings	130.1179
said the	55.6334
my own	1562.9532
said	20.7309
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to	367.4116
what do you desire it to	98.5844
what do you	22.7201
would you like to	89.6007
you jest i	2011.5778
i never	2240.7209
let me	383.5272
you shall not	281.5706
my brave young man i will blow out your	823.4324
hola lubin my	67403.0391
planchet called out dartagnan take care of the lackey i will manage the	352.7812
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet i have finished	862.7546
seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon dartagnan but he had too strong an	411.2280
at the third hit the gentleman fell like a	599.9017
and one for methe best for	2626.1704
cried dartagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his	1966.5638
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and	229.0593
dartagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the	255.5736
it was in the name of comte de	760.4110
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he	392.0331
i know him for a norman and normans are	3044.0774
in fact tightly held as he was lubin endeavored still to cry	4868.9980
said dartagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged	239.0776
now said planchet let us bind him to a	669.1569
and now said dartagnan to the	114.2560
but you are wounded it seems said	188.2400
oh thats	175.8294
and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy	1174.5695
the comte de wardes was announced and dartagnan was	1257.0491
you have an order signed by the	359.6658
said the	40.4435
yes monsieur replied dartagnan here it	228.1281
ah	213.9960
it is quite regular and explicit said the	472.0921
most likely said dartagnan i am one of his most faithful	269.7640
it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to	875.5700
do you know him	538.9446
asked the	40.4435
this	20.7309
perfectly	244.6467
describe him to me	38.7480
nothing more	56.7696
and dartagnan gave feature for feature a description of the comte de	3445.9985
is he	541.4622
yes by a lackey named	8868.9268
and by doing so monsieur the governor said dartagnan you will deserve well of the	278.9845
shall you see him on your return monsieur	307.2964
without a	223.8638
tell him i beg you that i am his humble	286.8995
i will not	158.8576
delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to	907.8455
dartagnan lost no time in useless	1293.9272
he thanked the governor bowed and	258.6931
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the	370.3487
said he on perceiving	70.2752
here is my pass countersigned said the	521.6994
and that other	264.5417
he will not go today said dartagnan but here ill pay you for us	354.5937
in that case let us go said the	787.8334
let us go repeated	1067.3663
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on	3375.2981
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when dartagnan saw a flash and heard a	894.9640
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the	475.0784
he had now leisure to look to his	1089.7633
fortunately as dartagnan had thought it was not	220.1829
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the	915.7446
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of	620.6638
dartagnan was worn out with	1824.0121
a mattress was laid upon the deck for	457.1307
he threw himself upon it and fell	389.6586
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of	494.8219
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little	427.9232
but that was not all they must get to	311.5137
in england the post was well	899.5728
dartagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before	1225.3508
in a few hours they were in the	218.0326
the duke was at windsor hunting with the	1482.2808
the confidence with which dartagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the	699.8297
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young	625.0391
dartagnan seemed	223.5502
in twenty minutes they were on the spot	363.2898
patrick soon caught the sound of his masters voice calling his	3110.5383
whom must i announce to my lord	242.8676
asked	568966592.0000
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the	1664.5438
a singular	746.3002
you will find that it is as good as	224.1397
patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited	771.7452
patrick discreetly kept in the	19854.2520
no misfortune has happened to the	65.8774
cried buckingham the instant he came up throwing all his fear and love into the	638.3818
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate	3097.0200
cried	1303.0059
what is	10.5801
i should be too happy to be of any service to	235.8164
speak	1054.6339
take this letter said	101.1223
this	5898.7686
from whom comes this	1066.9282
from her majesty as i	192.5270
from her	2821.6294
said buckingham becoming so pale that dartagnan feared he would faint as he broke the	1309.4518
what is this	6695.2114
said he showing dartagnan a place where it had been pierced	968.1737
you are	125.3003
asked buckingham as he opened the	312.9307
oh nothing but a scratch said	538.6997
just heaven what have i	204.5647
cried the	11.3105
come monsieur	34.8269
and both set off towards the capital at full	262.3604
chapter	237.0566
de wardes with such terrible	29353.6543
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of	376.3286
dartagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not	981.3811
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the	2348.3491
dartagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled	59239.8281
the duke walked so fast that dartagnan had some trouble in keeping up with	900.6256
encouraged by this invitation dartagnan followed the duke who closed the door after	821.0771
one might believe the queen was about to	324.7333
on the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond	1003.3292
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the	917.3095
the queen gave them to me the queen requires them	283.8916
her will be done like that of god in all	276.3291
then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to	573.7222
all at once he uttered a terrible	374.6538
what is the	21.4165
exclaimed dartagnan anxiously what has happened to you my	275.8936
all is	85.9498
cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only	584.4656
can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been	325.1513
they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this	478.5114
hold	850.9097
the ribbons which held them have been cut with	2705.3098
if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his	868.9867
wait	1702.9525
said the	11.3105
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that	3753.5571
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	993.9194
i have never seen her from that	132.1652
the woman is an agent of the	276.5850
he has agents then throughout the	1092.9481
cried	20.7309
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with	2145.3577
yes he is a terrible	462.5060
but when is this ball to take	387.7355
monday	2954.0574
monday	2954.0574
still five days before	113.8863
thats more time than we	281.3044
cried the duke opening the door of the chapel	918.8983
his confidential valet	3157.0823
my jeweler and my	8630.3936
the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without	2273.5610
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his	1055.8677
this was simply because he lived in the	584.3029
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own	1225.2748
i wish them to be promulgated	1545.8201
that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no	190.7251
you are right	102.0057
jackson replied	262.9457
the secretary bowed and	1596.6833
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward	691.6589
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after	395.1637
how	36.7079
buckingham saw by the expression of the young mans face what was passing in his mind and he	377.6499
yes said he yes anne of austria is my true	399.8272
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my	344.6406
i broke my word it is true but what signifies	389.6306
i obeyed my love and have i not been richly paid for that	762.4366
it was to that obedience i owe her	747.8923
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith	458.6674
how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like	937.8905
you see there are two	500.0537
eight days my	68.0947
i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after	308.4598
my lord they shall be	155.7325
you are a jewel of a man	253.5822
oreilly but that is not	38.2132
these studs cannot be trusted to anybody it must be done in the	584.5559
impossible my	3.6912
there is no one but myself can so execute them that one cannot tell the new from the	449.8215

the goldsmith knew the	385.9344
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to	1014.4399
may i be permitted to inform my	367.5831
said	71.5366
oh you may even see her if you like my dear	238.3407

buckingham gave dartagnan a chamber adjoining his	833.9328
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two	655.3077
he immediately called	67.3169
be satisfied my lord i will tell all that i have	174.3954
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the	580.5074

besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to	201.4796
you will say that i keep	87.7748
i will perform your commission word for word my	482.4146
dartagnan blushed up to the whites of his	435.7428
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your	210.7802
interrupted the young man	140.9339
we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of	2157.5039
and we say proud as a gascon replied	534.6552
the gascons are the scots of	1291.6057
dartagnan bowed to the duke and was	303.3682
well are you going away in that	202.6401
where and	383.1718

the name of that	82.1164
valery but	196.4595
you cannot be mistaken there is but	366.6284
you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word	215.1581

you will find in the same way four relays on your	933.4222
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you	489.0897
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a	418.6367
they were those we rode on and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to	433.8944
these horses are equipped for the	1359.6239
besides the end justified the means as you frenchmen say does it	668.7748
well now your hand young	251.1832
yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming	603.7482
be satisfied i promise you	240.3938
i depend upon your word my	305.1096
dartagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the	432.3339
fifty vessels were waiting to set	698.9733
the next day about nine oclock in the morning he landed at	168.2361
dartagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from	993.6180
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a	1465.6189
dartagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word	326.2964
i want to know the route i am to follow said	208.4861
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to	39058.9844

everything is paid replied the host and	1480.8318
begone and may god guide	283.2740
cried the young man and set off at full	207.7059
four hours later he was in	1915.1622
he strictly followed the instructions he had	740.2821
at neufchtel as at	29073.7422
valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting	635.3587
your address at	5801.5156
htel of the guards company of	170.1040
enough replied the	98.7035
which route must i	951.8840
demanded dartagnan in his	129.2687
that of rouen but you will leave the city on your	555.5370
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavernthe shield of	1965.1483
dont condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as	677.9713
the same	8005.9766
adieu	9599.0576
a good journey	449.2265
do you want	56.5263
dartagnan shook his head and set off at full	672.5500
at eccuis the same scene was	2132.6521
he found as provident a host and a fresh	620.8452
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for	1243.6956
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	569.7875
chapter	238.3765
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the htel de ville for this important	676.1801
these keys were given up to him	1209.6143
at three oclock came two companies of the guards one french the other	658.1183
the company of french guards was composed of half of	290.2672
duhalliers men and half of	142.8007
dessessarts	11299.9316
at six in the evening the guests began to	257.3918
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for	1884.8330
at nine oclock madame la premire prsidente	62919.3008
jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four	1240.9594
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were	1787.4519
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness	830.4136
de liancourt by	32558.8125
de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de	2173.3298
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and	945.2036
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for	262.1659
in each of these closets were placed masquerade	1295.8340
the same had been done for the queen and madame the	228.0490
the nobles and ladies of their majesties suites were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the	1686.8823
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal	546.0487
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard these announced the arrival of the	571.8136
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious	2115.7053
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even	562.8464
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the	129.0438
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very	241.0104
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely	496.9436
the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his	421.6703
and you were wrong	249.7413
if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself	1092.5974
i tell you that you were	86.7835
the voice of the king was tremulous with	413.0086
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what	496.7477
do so madame do so and that at once for within an hour the ballet will	868.8201
the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her	531.5118
on his part the king returned to his	217.5275
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the	369.8228
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to	3079.6106
the king came out first from his	285.7004
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like	837.5593
this was the costume that best became the	251.8516
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his	741.8871
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small	354.0944
the king opened it and found in it two diamond	386.2725
what does this	68.6976
demanded he of the	40.8784
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her	1531.6819
the queen had	97.7837
the only question was had she ten or	682.8027
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the	1350.0388
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the	490.7141
they took their places and the ballet	599.0576
a cold sweat covered the brow of the	188.4993
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen	4122.0005
with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given	182.3414
how	281.1342
cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have	849.0465
in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majestys	665.2948
the king called the	113.6188
what does this mean monsieur	268.5903
asked the king in a severe	213.0939
the queen had just regained her chamber and dartagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly	816.4305
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow	221.4965
dartagnan therefore followed	953.1622
bonacieux moved by a double sentimentlove and	3790.2261
at length after winding about for a minute or two	2489.0024
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led dartagnan into	485.5981
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by	468.9658
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she	1792.5116
the young man waited in comparative darkness and	1925.6067
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the	2621.1599
dartagnan at once comprehended that this was his	534.9290
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his	351.8346
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a	450.1303
the door immediately closed and dartagnan found himself again in complete	451.5330
dartagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet	498.2555
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to	252.9368
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely	2330.3455
supper was to be served at three and the clock of	181.4892
jean had struck three quarters past	602.3596
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining	2181.9077
the company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which dartagnan was was opened and	613.8462
bonacieux	1065.5092
you at	43.2979
cried	20.7309
said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips silence and go the same way you	317.2486
but where and when shall i see you	137.8927
cried	20.7309
a note which you will find at home will tell	270.8543
begone	351862.2812
at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed dartagnan out of the	233.2286
dartagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in	933.7418
chapter	270.4118
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting	6850.3442
the reader may ask how came planchet	1538.6588
when he was left stiff as a rush in	824.5026
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the	449.5102
has anyone brought a letter for	510.3036
asked dartagnan	105.6031
no one has brought a letter monsieur replied planchet but one has come of	699.4667
what do you mean	252.9314
and where is that	51.6286
i left it where i found it	221.6741
it is not natural for letters to enter peoples houses in this	2384.8811
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but noall was hermetically	2463.9880
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic	2104.5701
meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the	108.5999
it was from	148.4673
be this evening about ten oclock at	101.2995
cloud in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of	171.6549
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted	317.3026
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess	1576.4763
is it not some bad	315.1144
you are mistaken planchet replied dartagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my	432.4458
then monsieur is	99.6368
asked	448.9578
my dear planchet i am the happiest of	318.6528
and i may profit by monsieurs happiness and go to	2175.5706
yes	1903.8816
may the blessings of heaven fall upon	1705.7229
left alone dartagnan read and reread his	9254.3037
then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful	1281.5989
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden	863.4778
planchet said dartagnan i am going out for all day	219.7645
said	448.9578
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of	1533.2852
you will take your musketoon and your	1848.3418
there	2986.9795
didnt i say	41.6802
cried	448.9578
i was sure of itthe cursed	2541.0386
dont be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of	384.7205
ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel	4957.9570
well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed dartagnan i will go without	285.9395
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least	1469.0431
monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at	450.4253
yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first	409.7395
do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this	603.3882
i hope so	41.1394
well then i count on	129.4185
perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be	234.7133
it appears that our journey was a remounting journey	1904.0450
exactly so said dartagnan and nodding to planchet he went	166.7478
bonacieux was at his	70.1991
cloud opposite destress	280445.0625
dartagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could	543.3612
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor	1906.8108
for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your	392.6273
but you continued	79.2735
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these	775.2543
you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little	279.0571
far from	76.3584
oh lord	40.3884
about forty leagues	2111.0469
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still	1667.2511
and you have returned have you	52.3627
replied	30.2698
bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly	805.6224
my	285.7933
yes i was expected and very impatiently i	561.2542
a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that dartagnan did not perceive	753.5012
and we are going to be recompensed for our	606.3740
ah may you be a true	232.8506
said dartagnan	388.0432
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying	455.8061
why that question my dear	292.3237
asked	20.7309
do you intend to sit up for	169.7852
what the deuce can you	202.3777
i am no	932.5792
this time bonacieux became so pale that dartagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the	612.6830
nothing replied bonacieux	315.9413
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being	439.3553
then i have full occupation for i am	237.8122
not yet wait a	458.9484
this evening you	45.6728
well this evening will come thank	237.0894
so much the worse for you my dear host so much the	502.2872
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not	226.2062
the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could	744.9915
amuse yourself	21.8963
replied bonacieux in a sepulchral	3386.5220
he took his way toward the htel of	126.8429
he found trville in a joyful	1412.3279
he had thought the king and queen charming at the	240.7199
it is true the cardinal had been particularly	1903.5793
he had retired at one oclock under the pretense of being	1332.4067
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six oclock in the	433.5227
you must look out for	866.2925
everything believe	36.6496
do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to	276.5184
the	153.4100
you have been to	88.9401
was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your	4103.1079
beware my dear	18.7430
a present from an enemy is not a good	291.0849
are there not some latin verses upon that	1754.4523
there certainly is one said	134.3422
de trville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other	2189.7048
this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied dartagnan it comes from the	430.7270
from the	10.9245
oh	136.5505
said	30.2698
de	257.5922
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a	1013.9505
by whom did the queen send you this	490.0491
she gave it to me	202.9917
in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her	225.8481
giving me her hand to	205.9775
you have kissed the queens	1299.6302
said	30.2698
de trville looking earnestly at	1388.2924
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that	145.5306
and that in the presence of	221.9006
imprudent thrice	519894.2812
no monsieur be satisfied nobody saw her replied dartagnan and he related to	674.6201
de trville how the affair came to	405.3221
oh the women the	189.0718
cried the old	28.6676
i know them by their romantic	3360.8857
everything that savors of mystery charms	12058.6924
so you have seen the arm that was	119.1357
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you	234.5025
no but thanks to this diamond replied the young	346.3812
listen said	16.4241
de trville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a	646.0840
you will do me honor monsieur said	58.2287
well then off to the nearest goldsmiths and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from	1009.4823
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred	816.0934
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears	668.8807
sell this ring a ring which comes from my	1072.3806
said	20.7309
you think then i have something to	177.3072
asked	20.7309
the	153.4100
said dartagnan whom the positive tone of	629.6060
de trville began to disquiet the	1148.5697
what must i	38.1586
above all things be always on your	320.5625
but of what	135.2635
how can i	61.8125
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his	896.5593
the least that can be expected is that you will be	169.5379
will they dare to arrest a man in his majestys	627.6033
they did not scruple much in the case of	777.1745
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at	830.5818
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years	1207.8120
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistressyour mistress above	2725.6960
dartagnan	1279.8103
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically and why her rather than	1253.4800
because a mistress is one of the cardinals favorite means he has not one that is more	412.7905
a woman will sell you for ten pistoles witness	1978.1421
you are acquainted with the	456.8420
dartagnan thought of the appointment	718.0739
de trville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty	728.3184
but propos resumed	2818.3982
de trville what has become of your three	818.5682
i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of	211.8988

thanks	185.0368
dartagnan left	52.9257
de trville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his	1228.6622
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and	1692.0405
neither of them had	81.8948
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the	592.7950
as he passed the htel des gardes he took a glance into the	628.9176
three of the four horses had already	189.4142
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished	1864.1118
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving dartagnan how glad i am to see	258.8216

at nine oclock then be ready here at the htel i will come and take	268.5542
chapter	124.1774
the pavilion at nine oclock dartagnan was at the htel des gardes he found planchet all	1882.7544
the fourth horse had	1597.6139
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a	1309.6586
dartagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed	525.7242
it was quite dark and no one saw them go	525.9202
planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from	472.1488
dont you think monsieur that woods are like	2040.3104
how so	132.2348
because we dare not speak aloud in one or the	392.1915
but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchetbecause you are	583.0688
afraid of being	126.8024
yes	185.0368
afraid of being	126.8024
why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with	645.3149
ah	185.0368
what the devil makes you think of	194.9941
monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we	119.8600
because you are a coward	159.6570
monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a	1339.9473
and you are very virtuous are you not	148.1000
monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters	1686.4055
had we not better lower our	801.8321
in truth murmured dartagnan to whom	392.5764
de trvilles recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me	4205.5410
and he put his horse into a	453.0673
are we going to continue this pace all	1199.8496
asked	448.9578
no you are at your journeys	442.0890
how	185.0366
and	98.4007
i am going a few steps	1100.1948
and monsieur leaves me here	824.9977
you are afraid	271.6166
heres half a	613.7435
tomorrow	5585.8276
good lord how cold i	2164.1665
in the meantime dartagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached	1586.9736
it was situated in a very private	730.2484
dartagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind	2128.1133
but for dartagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were	4768.0566
the appointed hour was about to	805.2533
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of	389.8876
cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous	7041.4175
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty	2770.5422
bonacieux expected	120.8791
the belfry of	1829.4711
cloud sounded half past	118.2569
this time without knowing why dartagnan felt a cold shiver run through his	2206.5129
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral	848.5826
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven	724.6422
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this	619.8200
eleven oclock	448.0931
dartagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to	549.0510
he clapped his hands three timesthe ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an	3610.3457
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for	654.2378
the tree was easy to	6444.3120
besides dartagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy	1416.9045
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was	1247.2607
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the	7697.9292
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate	715.5521
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the	557.7731
at length dartagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a womans torn	2240.1814
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable	6631.5508
it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty	1894.5023
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with	719.9427
then dartagnan became almost	842.0673
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the	1259.0948
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	536.0717
bonacieux whom the boatman had	5369.2002
dartagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of	876.8720
bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at	341.8834
cloud and not elsewhere before the destress pavilion and not in another	1915.7375
everything conspired to prove to dartagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had	441.3411
he again ran back to the	324.0800
the lane was still deserted and the same calm soft light shone through the	1342.0524
dartagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its	1427.8534
no one answered to his first	506.5753
in the name of	47.0810
cried he listen to me i have been waiting for someone who has not	267.7152
i am dying with	342.5120
has anything particular happened in the	986.6409
the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than	446.6557
dartagnan related his story simply with the omission of	1561.7129
what do you	8.0716
cried	20.7309
in the name of heaven explain	211.1553
you have then seen	69.2234
replied	20.7309
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some	1057.4125
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as	738.7890
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you	104.9378
you must have a	305.5492
said he who appeared to be the leader of the	229.7309
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my	1034.3270
at these words he threw me a crown which i picked up and he took the	524.0941
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking	309.7805
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon	1366.6073
his two companions were already on	348.9622
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard	279.0934
can you guess said dartagnan who was the man who headed this infernal	1031.0978
i dont know	7.1505
but as you spoke to him you must have seen	130.3571
oh its a description you	889.2917
exactly	36.7080
a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a	770.6868
thats the	15.3677
cried dartagnan again he forever	363.8050
he is my demon	104.8494
and the	66.4450
the short	1012.2791
some lackey murmured	899.8521
poor woman poor woman what have they done with	122.1085
you have promised to be secret my good	194.5394
said the old	6.2805
and i renew my	218.0938
be easy i am a	170.8706
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you	214.6799
with a heavy heart dartagnan again bent his way toward the	1333.7607
sometimes he hoped it could not be	354.5283
his mind was torn by doubt grief and	1207.4354
it was past midnight the next thing was to find	459.2864
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather	1047.8372
dartagnan had appointed six oclock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was	331.0396
toward six oclock dartagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad	1775.7183
he was not long in making his	235.8109
chapter	45.3776
porthos instead of returning directly home dartagnan alighted at the door of	367.3956
de trville and ran quickly up the	208.1867
this time he had decided to relate all that had	180.2221
de trville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole	854.6165
besides as	44.6902
when dartagnan had finished he said	959.6326
all this savors of his eminence a league	1165.7946
but what is to be	49.7104
said	20.7309
nothing absolutely nothing at present but quitting paris as i told you as soon as	956.0709
rely on	41.6965
dartagnan knew that although a gascon	262.1485
determined to put the advice of	194.5818
on approaching the house he perceived	302.9222
bonacieux in morning costume standing at his	595.1052
it appeared then to dartagnan that	150.5171
bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look	858.9323
bonacieux accosted	269.6094
well young man said he we appear to pass rather gay	788.0420
seven oclock in the	340.0988
you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going	991.7465
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur	378.8475
bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly	2040.6451
ah	213.9960
said bonacieux you are a jocular	1908.7512
but where the devil were you gadding last night my young	2238.1570
it does not appear to be very clean in the	916.0223
both were stained with splashes of mud of the same	4654.6655
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of	454.1471
the husband had presided at the abduction of his	1777.9271
ah but you are joking my worthy	220.3122
said	20.7309
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur	1405.8969
oh the	37.2228
thats unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as	581.5782
oh	1108.0652
no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to	445.6849
bonacieux had named mand because mand was in an exactly opposite direction from	12966.8936
this probability afforded him his first	3947.8962
the question then was how to change this probability into a	788.0488
i am parched with	21157.2871
allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment you know that is never refused among	503.5121
it had not been	106.5386
bonacieux had not been	1439.3829
thanks monsieur bonacieux said dartagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of	563.3748
i will now go up into my	224.6114
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great	352.2776
ah	185.0368
cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more	658.0072
i thought you would never come	138.5206
whats the matter now	236.4585
demanded	20.7309
about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de	996.8802
who has been	42.8167
come	1054.6359
monsieur de	248032.5312
monsieur de	248032.5312
in	1471.5200
the captain of the cardinals	129.2506
did he come to arrest	163.3665
i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling	359.9005
was he so sweet	922.8348
indeed he was all honey	1914.3148
it was called the palaiscardinal before richelieu gave it to the	560.5458
what did you answer	41.5918
that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could	429.3638
well what did he say	52.1404
the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man	1536.7209
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your	996.2435
where has he	27.9839
asked monsieur de	3301.9082
to troyes in champagne i	33222.5156
and when did he set	505.4782
yesterday	10207.6445
planchet my friend interrupted dartagnan you are really a precious	401.8794
be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious	1549.4834
in a quarter of an hour we set	489.7553
in the opposite direction to that which you said i was	272.1967
yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you	141.9183
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of	964.4828
so then so then pack up our luggage planchet and let us be	1642.3163
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be	236.6683
you may join me at the htel des	2446.1482
ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you	252.2895
i am a physiognomist i assure	1296.3629
dartagnan went out first as had been agreed	336.7145
dartagnan took charge of	190.8607
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the htel des	2079.8208
dartagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse	493.7912
thats well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the	343.8192
now saddle the other three	600.2805
do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses	1354.6746
said planchet with his shrewd	17158.7598
which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of	424.1487
said dartagnan getting into his	706.1632
denisa strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate	6371.8398
dartagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte	5236.8560
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by	948.3842
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single	1645.0219
martin the same at which they had stopped on their first	279.2818
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the	1066.5991
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the	358.3162
dartagnan was therefore served with miraculous	9123.8369
take your glass then and let us	298.0145
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any	1731.8986
let us drink to the prosperity of your	443.3389
your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind	339.5632
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a	1068.9161
why i was here only ten or twelve days	303.5851
exactly so said the host i remember it	164.9166
it is not monsieur porthos that your lordship	427.8194
yes that is my companions	322.1437
my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to	234.1171
your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	695.4350
why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of	216.2758
he has done us the honor to remain	209.0737
what he had done you the honor to remain	230.4221
yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy on what	593.9272
of certain expenses he has	1761.0109
well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay	1215.5385
ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my	13091.4844
porthos is wounded	254.1039
i cannot tell you	172.1738
you cannot tell	83.1896
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other	485.1970
well can i see	59.4044
certainly	185.0369
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number	513.8324
only warn him that it is	130.7330
why should i do	47.4588
because monsieur some mischief might happen to	550.7275
of what kind in the name of	183.2478
what have you done to him	69.6153
we have asked him for	499.5370
the	153.4100
ah i can understand	43.5260
we thought so too	254.6525
it is true he had been playing the day	316.9325
playing the day	33.7379
and with	46.9769
lord who can say	149.2882
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of	814.9975
thats it then and the foolish fellow lost all he	467.8595
thats porthos all over murmured	406.1052
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his	786.2276
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his	651.1759
mousqueton is here	47.0437
oh yes	220.0179
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition	739.7155
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his	1621.2582
the fact is said dartagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in	907.6001
no for porthos will pay	109.1913
said the host in a doubtful	418.5016
if i durst say what i believe on that head what you	570.6916
i ought rather to say what i	136.5936
what you	38.0811
and even what i am sure	111.7111
and of what are you so	74.8123
i would say that i know this great	261.2559
yes	277.8750
and how do you know	78.1041
oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your	274.2171
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your	416.5950
well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	450.1612
what have you	63.2516
oh nothing which was not right in the character of a	380.3673
monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the	602.0021
this was before his servant	361.2772
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this	392.3660
and	76.0789
nearly	36.7080
well monsieur do you know who this great lady	319.4190
no i have heard porthos speak of her thats	352.2589
do you know who this pretended duchess	533.4903
i repeat to you i dont know	74.4978
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux	1932.7167
attorney but how do you know all	77.4642
has he been wounded	113.7215
oh good	32.7669
what have i	26.7867
you said that porthos had received a sword	274.7767
yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say	439.4685
and why	9.4739
zounds	185.0368
it is a wound that confines him to his	1440.3613
ah and a master stroke too i assure	582.2200
your friends soul must stick tight to his	11186.2549
were you there	47.7347
monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing	689.0831
and what took	345.7363
the affair was not long i assure	283.1719
he immediately fell	1537.6005
so it was with monsieur dartagnan this stranger meant to	623.2477
it appears	93.0790
and do you know what has become of	46.2040
no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him	298.2235
very well i know all that i wish to	57.8882
porthoss chamber is you say on the first story number	382.8467
yes monsieur the handsomest in the inna chamber that i could have let ten times	1383.4485
be satisfied said dartagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess	694.9053
and did you convey this answer to your	804.3369
we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his	627.4708
so that he still expects his	780.2219
oh lord yes	343.8783
yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the	367.8679
do you say the procurators wife is old and	564.6903
fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathauds	1505.1451
in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be	395.9007
besides porthos cannot owe you	455.7370
how not	79.7936
twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the	2103.8035
he denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live	1162.4181
never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for	607.7208
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation	448.0035
thats agreed you have my	246.8627
oh he would kill	59.0884
dont be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he	243.8647
dartagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the	377.2644
ah	734.5590
is that	59.0093
said porthos to	20.7742
you are right	63.3344
has the host told you nothing	162.8413
i asked after you and came up as soon as i	215.4000
porthos seemed to breathe more	170.3373
and what has happened to you my dear	119.1124
continued	20.7309
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure	374.9455
and what has became of	111.0409
oh i dont know he had enough and set off without waiting for the	438.2945
but you my dear dartagnan what has happened to	67.8990
so that this strain of the knee continued dartagnan my dear porthos keeps you in	582.4719
my god thats	253.3681
i shall be about again in a few	342.8211
why did you not have yourself conveyed to	266.0804
you must be cruelly bored	3179.5474
that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to	214.9787
whats	541.6255
but you my dear	27.6518
what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said	868.7008
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in	2641.3337
you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	795.0017
what consequence can the reverses of fortune be to	811.2930
have you not happy rogue that you arehave you not your duchess who cannot fail to come to your	669.5958
well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered	547.9237
no so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the	1039.1366
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of	76.5817
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your	597.5982
so so replied	67.0734
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the	524.9296
and yet said dartagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make	457.5235
and he again pointed to the bottles and the	510.3642
not i	138.7801
said	24.6358
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in	7862.7114
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of	1101.7466
mousqueton said dartagnan you must render me a	381.4647
what	185.0366
you must give your recipe to	1066.2247
lord	439.2676
there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest	509.0474
one only needs to be sharp thats	1332.6793
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a	587.1195
and what did he do the rest of his	173.3158
monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought	1271.3774
for my part monsieur i am catholicmy father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a	2233.8196
and what was the end of this worthy	87.4385
asked	20.7309
oh of the most unfortunate kind	370.6692
and what did you	12.2445
said	20.7309
we let them tell their story out replied	737.3137
well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent	683.4148
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a	760.0862
yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	661.9286
but the wine said dartagnan who furnishes the	330.1973
your	10687.3232
that is to say yes and	88.4990
how yes and	116.1028
he furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that	172.8535
explain yourself mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive	1793.1221
that is it	25.2276
what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the	717.3271
patience monsieur everything will come in its	422.0241
this spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in his voyage to	1311.9524
this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	1890.7805
well do you understand	46.3692
our host has a wellfurnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating	2471.1184
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of	456.8033
thank you my friend thank you unfortunately i have just	386.0371
willingly said	12.1337
but there the confidence of dartagnan	389.3011
martin he would call for him on his	167.7113
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet	1435.3666
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his	502.4292
chapter	196.2966
aramis and his thesis dartagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurators	367.1398
our barnais was a prudent lad however young he might	1150.4756
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they	1917.9706
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his	2898.2732
he thought of that young and pretty	541.5570
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt	418.5258
de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at	615.2285
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the	692.4407
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer	1015.7323
we depart from one place and arrive at another that is	383.1917
there only his memory returned to	400.3901
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received	315.0351
dartagnan was a	3012.9026
a handsome young man three or fourandtwenty years old mild amiable and well	1475.6862
that is hewounded in the	3862.5237
just	36.7080
well monsieur he is still	117.1372
ah	734.5590
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him	239.9474
pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this	222.7746
why	36.7080
has he a lady with	173.5826
what do you mean by	32.1228
poor	1079896.7500
no monsieur he has not a lady with	238.9154
with whom is he	63.2432
with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of	1237.1615
good	323.6718
cried dartagnan is the poor fellow worse	216.4496
no monsieur quite the contrary but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take	921.6458
thats	293.2233
said dartagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a	243.9263
monsieur still insists upon seeing	1358.7561
more than	102.7091
bazin was then at the height of	211.4292
in all probability this time his master would not	687.9084
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long	5533.3433
but dartagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of	731.6136
the door opened and dartagnan went into the	136.9850
at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits and on his left the curate of	481.3367
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific	5447.3335
good day dear dartagnan said aramis believe me i am glad to see	982.9927
to himself my friend to	116.6395
but what makes you doubt	169.1310
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemeni was afraid you were dangerously	1422.3213
aramis colored	239.9926
you disturb	3598.5723
ah hell come round thought dartagnan thats not	1483.8649
praise god monsieur replied they bowing	480.4138
i have not failed to do so your reverences replied the young man returning their	1307.8237
the two men in black bowed in their	334.9563
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very	662.0135
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and	3514.3704
your	4782861.0000
are you then making a	626.8715
without doubt replied the	1657.3889
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a	5032.0293
de trville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that dartagnan had received from the duke of	765.8888
an admirable	5150.1079
cried the	5633.8540
admirable and	316537.5938
as to dartagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in	520.5600
yes	466890.1250
prorsus	881996160.0000
continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the	710.6085
dartagnan began to be tired and so did the	671.8179
see what an	3396.9893
cried the	5633.8540
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying	723.6274
quemadmodum inter clorum	1537819264.0000
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit monsieur dartagnan will enjoy our conversation	749.6021
yes replied dartagnan i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses	1276.8691
well let us see what is to be derived from this	529.8420
besides what does the gospel	451.0288
imponite manus and not manumplace the hands not the	2482.4041
place the hands repeated the curate with a	414.9232
peter on the contrary of whom the popes are the successors continued the jesuit porrige digitospresent the	4608.2529
are you there	67.9500
certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is	393.3112
the fingers resumed the jesuit	3446.0315
peter blessed with the	2061.5271
the pope therefore blesses with the	6775.8770
and with how many fingers does he	6817.1587
with three fingers to be sureone for the father one for the son and one for the holy	792.8242
all crossed	1225.3700
dartagnan thought it was proper to follow this	751.0318
the pope is the successor of	289.0190
there is the subject	3017.3623
argumentum omni denudatum	1147939712.0000
chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its	2786.3320
dartagnan	11661.6650
stop	960.2670
cried the jesuit for that thesis touches closely upon	21090.4453
take care my young	134.9065
you are inclining toward false doctrines my young friend you will be	5595.5576
you will be lost said the curate shaking his head	667.0085
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal	1315.2177
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the	3525.8918
but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his	2058.9746
listen to this dilemma god is god and the world is the	353.1974
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my	267.6993
and that is mine also said the	249.3248
but for heavens sake resumed	592.8286
desideras diabolum unhappy	499661.4062
cried the	5633.8540
he regrets the	786.0214
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore	1039.0564
dartagnan felt himself	134.5087
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he	405.3549
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they	1935.2480
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little	723.7541
i do not say i regret no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be	697.2330
the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the	692.8879
dont you think so	44.7637
i think so indeed cried	113.2576
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their	5984.3569
this is the point of departure it is a	595.1480
the world is not wanting in	849.0647
i quit the world then i make a	701.9249
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the	4821.5015
that is true said his	1072.3735
a	70840.2344
said the jesuit	11668.0957
a	70840.2344
said the curate	778.7110
repeat	293.2233
repeat	293.2233
cried dartagnan it will make a little	191.2562
not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in	902.8817
the	153.4100
said	20.7309
dartagnan and the curate appeared	871.0386
the jesuit persisted in his	8636.1582
beware of a profane taste in your theological	7470.1377
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum	149429.8438
yes let the sermon be clear said the	1156.9803
please	866.8796
cried aramis	189861.2656
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisim	3024.2246
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not	2168.3137
be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for	219.5355
mundane	583313088.0000
i know myself father my resolution is	549.1157
then you persist in continuing that	2899.2573
i feel myself called upon to treat that and no	586.5120
work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of	406.4128
plague stifle you and your	1122.3837
said dartagnan who began to feel all his patience	722.9808
farewell my son said the curate till	313.9810
till tomorrow rash youth said the	6940.3867
you promise to become one of the lights of the	212.8353
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring	1934.9934
dartagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the	1588.6937
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and dartagnan and advanced toward the	189.0530
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed	871.9203
yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just	2362.8108
oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long	1058.3865
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my	216.5482
yes but i confess i always thought you	529.2443
with such	2016.6218
oh	20.7309
the	153.4100
why people jest with	1111.0857
and people are wrong dartagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to	1148.2274
granted but if you please let us not theologize	990.7028
you must have had enough for	484.4441
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever	1052.3256
then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing since ten oclock this morning and i am devilish	389.9941
we will dine directly my friend only you must please to remember that this is	838.4960
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it	1676.7336
if you can be satisfied with my dinnerit consists of cooked tetragones and	24073.4590
what do you mean by	1029.2159
asked dartagnan	758.5369
and so aramis you are decidedly going into the	844.9116
what will our two friends	198.0090
what will monsieur de trville	367.3485
they will treat you as a deserter i warn	788.2952
i do not enter the church i reenter	542.9753
i deserted the church for the world for you know that i forced myself when i became a	592.4895
i know nothing about	182.6897
you dont know i quit the	1844.7308
not at	54.9059
this is my story	68.9312
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you	300.9471
and i give you absolution	750.7762
you see i am a good sort of a	179.2745
do not jest about holy things my	878.6910
go on then i	119.5358
i had been at the seminary from nine years old in three days i should have been	411.5547
i was about to become an abb and all was	243.6339
one is	198.2467
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this	3119.8279
he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with	425.5419
monsieur the abb said he do you like blows with a	376.7820
i cannot say monsieur answered i no one has ever dared to give me	385.3192
well listen to me then monsieur the	96.9736
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it	335.8252
i really think i must have been	272.3405
i returned to the	2076.1558
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear	475.7719
it was in the rue des francebourgeois close to la	1913.7627
as i expected my officer was	216.4186
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue	1096.0581
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey	366.8540
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me	255.3705
i do not know	25.7056
i am said i the little abb who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into	6296.6147
ah	213.9960
i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone well what do you want with	557.1048
i want you to spare time to take a walk with	373.2389
tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest	394.7393
no not tomorrow morning if you please but	560.2368
if you absolutely	1889.5709
i do insist upon	1285.8348
come	76.0789
we went	5.1185
it was a superb moonlight	1353.4742
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark	1026.8658
the	153.4100
cried	20.7309
you may understand that the moment has come for me to reenter the bosom of the	413.8721
and why today rather than yesterday or	1008.5066
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy	1889.6069
this wound my dear dartagnan has been a warning to me from	376.4746
this	349978.1250
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most	423.6600
what	76.0789
said aramis	1600.0811
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painfula wound made by a	1340.6406
the eye of aramis kindled in spite of	1096.8940
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love	2420.9421
vanitas	603995968.0000
according to your idea then my brain is	315.9131
and for whomfor some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some	12790.0020
pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes	536.8978
and who am i to nourish such	1086.7437
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknownwho hates slavery and finds himself illplaced in the	11951.8271
aramis	79.6394
cried dartagnan looking at his friend with an air of	253.7778
dust i am and to dust i	135.4020
oh my dear dartagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust	988.1796
conceal your wounds when you have any silence is the last joy of the	428.6555
alas my dear aramis said dartagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are	812.3414
yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by	1265.6451
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted	577.6016
she is perhaps a prisoner she is perhaps	193.3099
nothing replied aramis	85.2392
so you renounce the world then forever that is a settled thinga resolution	1148.1075
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing	568.8232
the	153.4100
all this is very sad which you tell	218.7783
what will	9.1699
my vocation commands me it carries me	1162.0905
dartagnan smiled but made no	167.5153
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of youof our	394.4005
to love you cry	6206.3120
friends are	247.9355
the world is a	2852.7983
alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a	349.5693
what	5898.7573
cried aramis	151.2268
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for	318.0069
but from whom is that	183.6630
what do you	23.7790
i must have lost it said the young man maliciously pretending to search for	944.0514
dartagnan dartagnan cried aramis you are killing	380.0074
well here it is at	120.3586
said dartagnan as he drew the letter from his	293.8052
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance	987.3620
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger	4610.6797
thanks dartagnan	166.3724
cried aramis almost in a state of	711.9882
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves	673.1744
come my friend come let me embrace	123.5118
happiness almost stifles	15859.8184
the two friends began to dance around the venerable	3226.1794
chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the	2477.8179
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the	904.9221
be off you	143.4130
cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his	1754.7694
return whence you came take back those horrible vegetables and that poor	7246.7305
order a larded hare a fat capon mutton leg dressed with garlic and four bottles of old	25302.1387
non inutile desiderium	1183679232.0000
go to the devil with your	382.8325
let us drink my dear dartagnan	811.7795
let us drink while the wine is	482.9357
chapter	101.5133
do you think then that any harm can have happened to	163.3408
asked	79.6394
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so	2497.1575
no	192.4236
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving	1883.5131
those fellows strike hard and dont leave off in a	2963.1199
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as	437.8399
i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on	502.0250
when do you mean to set	32.0889
tomorrow at	958.1146
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure	430.6096
till tomorrow then said aramis for ironnerved as you are you must need	886.7139
the next morning when dartagnan entered aramiss chamber he found him at the	387.7645
what are you looking	58.0758
asked	20.7309
my	285.7933
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading	8937.4561
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such	523.7130
well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is	722.2847
ah	4729.6206
whichever of the three you like i have no	499.7803
and the rich caparison is that mine	1260.4368
without	3485.7212
you laugh	37.2176
no i have left off laughing now that you speak	403.8378
what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silverare they all for	9640.1660
they are three superb	2994.8608
i am glad they please	365.6624
why it must have been the king who made you such a	250.1136
i choose that which the redheaded boy is	2330.5933
it is	80.3452
good	242.3603
that is enough to drive away all my pains i could mount him with thirty balls in my	937.7479
on my soul handsome	4965.7314
hol bazin come here this	2307.8364
bazin appeared on the threshold dull and	2812.4668
that last order is useless interrupted dartagnan there are loaded pistols in your	1339.5448
bazin	1048.9490
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said dartagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of	1403.5458
well but my poor bazin reflect a	479.8099
of what use is it to be a churchman	301.4887
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of	1887.2999
he is a cardinal	502.8458
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of	1170.0929
sighed	27531.7441
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsyturvy in the world	1095.2754
while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey	944.8440
thats all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he i will go alone in search of	257.6090
you are a man of brass replied	729.4295
no i have good luck that is	238.5142
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come	310.6859
no more theses no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions	19708.4453
aramis	121.6219
i will make verses said	198.7428
yes i dare say verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de	1166.4668
teach bazin prosody that will console	13605.8389
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his	688.1127
oh make yourself easy on that head replied	449.1766
you will find me ready to follow	108.0435
how was he going to find	97.9142
should he find him at	118.0639
the position in which he had left him was	246.2066
he probably had	4387.2773
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and	781.0471
yet he entertained a marked preference for this	1096.5695
indeed when placed beside	640.7534
de trville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a	2218.5527
etiquette had no minuti unknown to	1731.7103
he knew what were the rights of the great land	1048.1434
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master	921.8861
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to	1219.6962
this athos then was a very extraordinary	311.7162
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a	1061.1392
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not	510.3170
june and july were the terrible months with	581.0685
for the present he had no	260.7297
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the	435.9716
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to	291.3206
without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his masters audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to	2635.0564
do you remember how he cried on dartagnan on i am	207.2431
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his	761.3932
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were	1036.0059
do you remember	18.7935
said he to the host who advanced to greet	510.0752
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which dartagnan	820.0211
what you dont know	33.5126
no	4391.0654
well two words will refresh your	1032.0481
ah monseigneur do not mention	324.6886
cried the host in the most pitiable voice	1017.4027
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i	2597.1692
that gentleman i say what has become of	132.9688
deign to listen to me monseigneur and be	193.1860
sit down in	379.6294
dartagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a	603.1238
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his	2435.2688
here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for i now recollect	623.7413
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak	365.7229
condescend to listen to me and you shall know	83.6154
i	974.1349
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenancesnothing was	2152.7368
go on go	8.6102
said dartagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had	1472.5272
said dartagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word	29725.4531
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my	912.7344
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the	967.8187
but once again that gentlemanwhere is	1733.6511
what has become of	128.6283
is he	177.0828
is he	4140.3242
patience monseigneur we are coming to	251.2071
that gentleman your friend defended himself	10092.5039
cried dartagnan you were all in the plot	202.1918
and i really dont know what prevents me from exterminating you	586.1190
alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon	478.4336
you villain will you	1415.8590
cried dartagnan athoswhat has become of	1169.0249
as we were sure of finding him there we left him	379.4939
yes said dartagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison	244.2530
good	866.8788
to imprison him	88222.8984
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he	184.5796
monsieur the governor was all	357.1999
but	36.8714
cried dartagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is	1032.7166
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a	241.5070
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully	966.0270
but where is athos	33.9694
cried	20.7309
where is	33.4873
in the cellar	638.4742
what you	96.9082
have you kept him in the cellar all this	330.7236
merciful	242.3603
no	504.3259
we keep him in the	980.2259
you do not know what he is about in the	194.0728
then he is	28.7947
i shall find him	326.6820
without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining	698.9103
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest	1971.3501
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible	720.4974
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his	1285.9857
so that since that time replied dartagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the	1153.3884
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined	704.6126
and not more than justice either you	1337.0771
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not	444.6552
yes monsieur you are right said the	72.9616
but hark	5393061.0000
there he	87.5043
somebody has disturbed him without doubt said	314.3023
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just	624.4058
well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the	376.6367
ah good	157.6223
there is the hullabaloo louder than	3172.2209
dartagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the	314.4994
the two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and	835.6641
but this is	580.9178
softly	873.2681
said dartagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you	1615.6447
good	915.2416
brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other	359.2818
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have	110.2358
good	866.8788
cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear dartagnan i	440.4676
yes cried dartagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my	251.5550
ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door	1738.2899
the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two	1909.9629
stand on one side dartagnan stand on one side cried	413.2816
i am going to	146.5347
gentlemen exclaimed dartagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are	792.1682
patience	36.8714
you are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be	2186.4956
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the	365.3020
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably	432.5380
let me conduct your business and my	189.3068
you shall soon have something to drink i give you my	220.6526
if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of	1135.4375
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his	3654.8792
if there is any	77.6805
murmured	71.5366
what the	37.2227
there must be plenty left replied	816.5667
be satisfied of that these two cannot have drunk all the	915.2299
gentlemen return your swords to their	1039.7206
well provided you replace your pistols in your	2133.8848
and dartagnan set the	642.6679
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his	2184.6216
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords	36247.6172
the englishmen bowed and went	2151.0488
now i am alone my dear athos said dartagnan open the door i beg of	158.6927
instantly said	13.2381
dartagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him	547.6411
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos	564.0665
you are wounded said	147.0928
not at	54.9059
i am dead drunk thats all and never did a man more strongly set about getting	1590.4735
by the lord my good	86.5215
i must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty	980.1772
cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined	468.6352
grimaud is a wellbred	439.8555
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the	988.6467
i dont think he put the faucet in	1590.6890
do you hear	50.6859
it is running	803.4361
dartagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning	600.5676
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of	6038.4697
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	3395.9885
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of	3070.6309
of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten	8317.6523
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	328.9719
dartagnan himself was moved by	212.5207
athos did not even turn his	167.6578
to grief succeeded	1267.8179
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two	1031.5365
some	2248.6411
said athos on perceiving the	77.4402
some	2248.6411
cried the stupefied host some	1763.5092
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles	997.2549
i am a ruined man lost	583.7498
bah said athos we were always	821.2150
if you had been contented with drinking well and good but you have broken all the	485.8726
you pushed me upon a heap which rolled	649.4316
that was your	603.2069
all my oil is	1609.1940
all my sausages are	12255.2734
there is an enormous quantity of rats in that	1841.9534
you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated	591.3018
triple	1051205.2500
said athos rising but he sank down again	1411.0145
he had tried his strength to the	381.4918
dartagnan came to his relief with his whip in his	329.6393
the host drew back and burst into	167.0397
this will teach you said dartagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous	843.7525
say the	37.2228
oh gentlemen said the host i have been	449.7225
i confess it but pardon to every	931.5774
you are gentlemen and i am a poor	342.0904
you will have pity on	54.1016
we are not such devils as we appear to	295.9899
come hither and let us	148.5236
the host approached with	643.3646
come hither i say and dont be afraid continued	377.6780
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the	308.3132
yes	185.0368
that purse contained sixty pistoles where is	2264.5146
deposited with the justice they said it was bad	299.1979
very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty	671.4016
but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold	1300.0399
if it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good	833.0104
come said dartagnan let us inquire	238.2685
athoss horse where is	136.2197
in the	1516.4390
how much is it	78.3925
fifty pistoles at	970.9189
its worth	3924.5325
take it and there ends the	280.4397
what cried athos are you selling my horsemy	8746.1123
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon	767.7748
i have brought you another said	194.8715
and a magnificent	190.6189
cried the	17.3052
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us	1177.0133
asked the host quite cheerful	283.3313
some of that at the bottom near the	577.7082
there are twentyfive bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my	823.1749
bring six of	67.9978
why this man is a	798.1745
said the host	185.7019
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon reestablish my	1983.6754
and dont forget said dartagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english	620.4191
and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me dartagnan what has become of the others	352.7827
thats	244.6467
said athos filling his glass and that of his friend heres to porthos and	361.7297
but you dartagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you	112.2791
you have a sad	258.8658
alas said dartagnan it is because i am the most	164.6236
tell	130.0698
presently said	12.1337
and why	1401.7627
because you think i am	226.3799
dartagnan remember	37.2068
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of	862.4852
speak then i am all	192.2565
dartagnan related his adventure with	7952.4360
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only	2073.4370
that was his favorite	120.1704
you always say trifles my dear	693.5110
said dartagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never	496.8465
the drinkdeadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as	1753.0258
thats true said he quietly for my part i have never	411.4760
acknowledge then you stony heart said dartagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender	1130.8842
tender	1097500.1250
pierced	1097500.1250
said	36.8714
what do you	23.7790
i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins	4348.4258
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear	202.8760
and if i have any counsel to give it is always	193.1121
she seemed to love me	72.6674
she seemed did	414.4209
oh she did love	127.1863
except you athos who never had	181.6216
thats true said athos after a moments silence thats	974.9821
i never had	119.8742
let us	240.9982
but then philosopher that you are said dartagnan instruct me support	852.7513
i stand in need of being taught and	739.7334
consoled for	135.4452
for my	157.2396
which has happened to	30.1315
or one of my friends what	144.0245
tell it athos tell	53.1818
better if i	232.5187
drink and relate	608.0156
not a bad	300.2236
said athos emptying and refilling his	2931.6360
the two things agree marvelously	10623.8203
i am all attention said	152.6076
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so dartagnan saw that he became	660.8488
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to	1299.5831
he kept himself upright and dreamed without	1957.0920
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in	7616.5288
you particularly wish	325.9548
asked	71.5366
i pray for it said	162.9624
be it then as you	113.0434
through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the	1440.2192
she did not please she	926.6490
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a	525.8392
both had recently come into the	2290.6716
they were said however to be of good	904.4429
who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown	506.7560
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married	374.3281
the	1928.6732
the	1051205.2500
the	139966.8906
how so if he loved	270.7416
asked	20.7309
wait said	13.2381
asked	20.7309
dartagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her	1086.9265
how can i	61.8125
said	20.7309
a fleurdelis said	38806.5820
she was	24960.9219
athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his	567.3894
cried	20.7309
what do you tell	18.1591
truth my	14.3044
the angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a	1173.0587
and what did the count	31.9666
the count was of the highest	485.6482
he had on his estates the rights of high and low	2019.7272
heavens athos a	250.1575
cried	20.7309
no less said athos as pale as a	448.2042
but methinks i need	8012.5688
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while dartagnan stood before him	842.8695
god grant you as	287.8320
let us	240.9982
then she is	46.1397
stammered	20.7309
said	36.8714
but hold out your	1127.8416
some ham my boy or we cant	2860.4932
and her	6860.6870
added dartagnan	4515.0200
her	38389.6016
replied	36.8714
yes the	30.6355
was it ever known who this miserable fellow	676.6987
he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair	385.4518
he has been hanged and quartered i	1669.2764
my god my	6.5207
cried dartagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible	2035.0509
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the	394.0255
i could have drunk fifty bottles	5676.4004
dartagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him	679.3871
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to	465.3529
chapter	82.1132
besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter	875.3199
i wager that i uttered a thousand	2550.1045
while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed	675.4756
no replied dartagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common	283.6716
ah you surprise	283.2315
i thought i had told you a most lamentable	1695.5814
and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his	194.3284
my faith said dartagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the	316.1630
that is my failinga capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good	2366.0566
athos spoke this in so natural a manner that dartagnan was shaken in his	486.3810
we were speaking of	139.2504
yes yes replied	17.0206
i remember now yes it was aboutstop a minuteyes it was about a	1872.8245
yes that was it said dartagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue	694.9367
yes who was	185.3363
by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued dartagnan looking intently at	830.2702
i certainly never will get drunk again dartagnan it is too bad a	1439.9039
is it to your	74.8475
asked	20.7309
yes but it is not a horse for hard	229.5365
ah you begin to awaken my	856.5037
yes i have parted with	674.9814
why here is the simple	165.2442
this morning i awoke at six	96.6617
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut	1186.2832
pardieu said i my good gentleman i have a horse to sell	170.9140
ay and a very fine	174.2119
i saw him yesterday your friends lackey was leading	1194.6619
do you think he is worth a hundred	302.0269
will you sell him to me for that	188.5606
no but i will play for	158.7314
at	3850466.5000
no sooner said than done and i lost the	299.8530
ah	213.9960
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried	1143.5355
dartagnan looked much	20354.6445
this vexes	7776.7427
said	36.8714
well i must confess it does replied	117.0274
that horse was to have identified us in the day of	593.4101
it was a pledge a	694.8801
athos you have done	119.3705
but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the	230.7095
i was hipped to death and still further upon my honor i dont like english	1616.8091
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable	475.9629
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its	1985.5010
why the	37.2228
a horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the	5046.8896
dartagnan did not	126.6196
what else have you	125.1592
after having lost my own horse nine against tensee how neari formed an idea of staking	11015.1807
yes but you stopped at the idea i	1060.2843
no for i put it in execution that very	441.1749
and the	1838.5082
said dartagnan in great	383.9429
i threw and i	127.7960
what my	81.2295
your horse seven against eight a point shortyou know the	4693.6782
athos you are not in your right senses i	278.3312
i lost him then with all his appointments and	818.0586
really this is	100.6012
stop a minute you dont know all	423.7923
well i was not hotheaded then well but what else could you play	498.9593
you had nothing	88.5809
this	610557.2500
said dartagnan placing his hand eagerly on his	401.2660
i hope said dartagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my	740.1794
athos you make me	148.1833
cried	20.7309
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked	1063.8044
go on go on my dear	135.5890
said dartagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your	224.3690
we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	1058.7273
you are laughing at me and want to try	265.2289
said dartagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the	6346.2480
no i do not jest	249.0750
i should like to have seen you in my	157.6241
that was no reason for staking my	1628.5695
replied dartagnan closing his hand with a nervous	982.6252
hear the	83.4646
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that	1415.6329
cried dartagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding	299.9482
said athos i had a	216.7914
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten	8780.7197
well what	43.5256
said dartagnan laughing in spite of	276.8478
grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the	875.0717
tell me now if persistence is not a	705.4245
my	285.7933
but this is droll cried dartagnan consoled and holding his sides with	1603.1962
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the	2550.2581
the	153.4100
said dartagnan becoming angry	938.0926
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost	397.7972
in brief i regained your harness and then	2516.6328
thats where we	51.9526
that was a superb throw so i left off	1043.7550
dartagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	1270.1353
then the diamond is	354.6213
said he	137.9403
intact my dear friend besides the harness of your bucephalus and	1152.9963
but what is the use of harnesses without	1322.1311
i have an idea about	158.3504
athos you make me	102.7187
listen to	130.5184
you have not played for a long time	225.6505
and i have no inclination to	356.2081
swear to	434.7325
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good	205.9576
well what	22.1857
well the englishman and his companion are still	320.6327
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very	3287.4954
you appear to think much of your	232.5070
in your place i would stake the furniture against the	923.4621
but he will not wish for only one	516.9661
stake both	2572.6155
i am not selfish as you	332.9457
you would do	107.0052
said dartagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of	956.5037
on my honor in one single	981.3184
but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the	1442.8978
stake your diamond	411.8495
thats another	119.5389
never	1638.7281
the	153.4100
said	36.8714
decidedly my dear athos said dartagnan i should like better not to risk	428.5358
thats a pity said athos	987.2334
the englishman is overflowing with	1626.4709
good lord try one	1149.7122
one throw is soon	441.4265
and if i	77.7206
you will	2711.9460
but if i	77.7206
well you will surrender the	1754.9193
have with you for one	190.7655
said	20.7309
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy	1930.1737
the opportunity was	840.7524
he proposed the conditionsthe two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred	4384.9390
the englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred	3761.6631
he	341384.8125
the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the	1246.9301
hold hold	109.3910
said athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is	1591.6768
i have not seen such a one four times in my	255.3067
two	674305024.0000
the englishman looked and was seized with	369.3056
dartagnan looked and was seized with	397.4851
then monsieur takes his horse back again said the	1328.5717
certainly said	12.1337
then there is no	90.2312
our conditions said no revenge you will please to	489.8202
that is true the horse shall be restored to your lackey	618.0073
a moment said athos with your permission monsieur i wish to speak a word with my	222.5363
say	783.0085
athos drew dartagnan	327.8744
well tempter what more do you want with	724.0444
said	20.7309
you want me to throw again do you	272.1057
no i would wish you to	110.4650
on	223.8640
you mean to take your	210.7770
without	3485.7212
you are wrong	113.3100
i would take the hundred	264.3319
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your	1453.5977
well then i repeat you are	183.1344
what is the use of one horse for us	195.2905
i could not ride	1482.2362
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their	1644.8063
you cannot think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent	5702.6128
for my part i should not hesitate a moment i should take the hundred	443.2588
we want money for our return to	208.0241
i am much attached to that horse	310.5864
and there again you are	182.7311
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their	841.5277
but how shall we get	150.9663
upon our lackeys horses	2907.2400
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of	665.2834
pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their	5845.4341
cried athos and laughed	1772.5890
what is	10.5801
asked dartagnan who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his	319.6378
nothing	1443.0349
go	783.0089
your advice	103.8312
to take the hundred pistoles	173.1012
with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the	341.4805
we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no	827.0459
i	199643.8594
oh no	57.9102
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate	895.1962
take the hundred pistoles my friend take the hundred	489.4777
dartagnan only required one reason to be	706.2484
this last reason appeared	8047.8501
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of	775.2639
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the	1454.1807
they then determined to	180.9644
peace with the landlord in addition to athoss old horse cost six	2951.0950
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at	1204.6014
hol	79.6394
what the devil are you doing	66.9256
cried the two	199.1391
ah is that you dartagnan and you	79.4553
said the young	27.7476
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave	1320.9352
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est	54812.8633
which means said dartagnan who began to suspect the	248.9176
dartagnan and athos laughed	1772.5898
my dear dartagnan said aramis dont be too angry with me i	341.4837
ah you fellows are good	687.2484
you ride on our lackeys horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short	3340.6199
what is	16.9405
said aramis on seeing them	439.9736
nothing but	3355.3870
now do you	15.4719
said	36.8714
my friends thats exactly like	852.0112
i retained my harness by	7968.6675
hol	27531.7441
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these	836.6169
and what have you done with your	709.9568
asked	20.7309
my dear fellow i invited them to a dinner the next day replied	750.7693
they have some capital wine hereplease to observe that in	2286.6614
i did my best to make them	715.4371
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a	1282.2836
without a	1330.0277
cried dartagnan without a	964.0736
i demand the suppression of the	500.2092
since then continued aramis i have lived very	2184.6301
i have begun a poem in verses of one	3284.5215
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the	821.3399
the matter is	1398.8087
i will read you the first	903.0372
it has four hundred lines and lasts a	1171.6864
you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable	6907.1274
and so my friends we return to	173.5326
i am	67.8673
we are going to rejoin that good fellow	387.9224
so much the	35.5445
you cant think how i have missed him the great	778.6375
to see him so selfsatisfied reconciles me with	3358.8606
he would not sell his horse not for a	239.8686
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome	2107.5615
i am sure he will look like the great	1197.1836
they made a halt for an hour to refresh their	786.6008
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join	2020.5066
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb	118289.9297
ah	734.5590
said he rising you come in the nick of time	431.8383
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with	543.8745
oh	136.5505
said dartagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his	1317.4811
besides here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of	17923.8438
i am recruiting myself said porthos i am recruiting	2870.6892
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish	13794.3965
did you ever suffer from a strain	1228.0011
but this dinner was not intended for you alone	408.0722
said	79.6394
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not	472.0055
you will take their places and i shall not lose by the	558.2113
hol mousqueton seats and order double the	1770.5667
do you know what we are eating	128.9377
said athos at the end of ten	222.4158
replied dartagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and	10646.6611
and i some lamb chops said	6531.0107
and i a plain chicken said	915.9847
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating	367.8151
eating	223.8638
said	20.7309
said aramis with a grimace of	1896.3207
porthos alone made no	210.4372
yes	861.8086
are we not eating a horse	633.9977
and perhaps his saddle	54172.6211
no gentlemen i have kept the harness said	574.7062
my faith said aramis we are all	994.9726
one would think we had tipped the	9236.8984
what could i	43.2871
said	24.6358
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i dont like to humiliate	1581.9961
then your duchess is still at the	451.9173
asked	20.7309
still replied	21.1049
gave	454.9271
cried	20.7309
without the	914.0480
said	79.6394
yes without the	1351.7567
you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of	512.3563
there is one comfort we are all in cash said	387.9145
that has weakened my	1528.2094
and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me	325.1898
ay	825098560.0000
in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns	834.0880
and i about ten pistoles said	485.2185
well then it appears that we are the crsuses of the	541.9285
how much have you left of your hundred pistoles	177.6465
of my hundred	9107.8750
why in the first place i gave you	148.2971
you think	4.2483
ah that is	42.0471
i	50490.1016
then i paid the host	483.2992
what a brute of a	273.4991
why did you give him six	380.8633
you told me to give them to	52.3365
it is true i am too	374.4381
in brief how much	2587.2893
twentyfive pistoles said	349.4175
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i	591.1682
my	285.7933
so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	454.7937
now then let us calculate how much we posses in	2208.8826
thirty	53115.3555
ten	8794.5479
and you	31.1905
that makes in	324.5154
said	36.8714
four hundred and seventyfive livres said dartagnan who reckoned like	7608.7896
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said	1376.3121
but our troop	947.7386
said	79.6394
let us dine then said porthos it is getting	511.4732
on arriving in paris dartagnan found a letter from	503.8118
as this was the height of dartagnans worldly ambitionapart be it well understood from his desire of finding	1828.5004
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some	1358.6466
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of	1585.8942
de trville never jested in matters relating to	9117.8340
and what do you reckon your outfit will	1529.4238
said	20.7309
oh we can scarcely	664.1620
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred	5145.5767
four times fifteen makes sixtysix thousand livres said	3627.0144
stop said he i have an	70.6672
a thousand	3418.3240
for my part i declare i want two	403.0800
what the	37.2227
chapter	24.6465
to this preoccupation of his vanity dartagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	1471.1685
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting	720.3517
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of	1197.4514
de trville had spoken of her to the	144.9383
athos did not leave his chamber he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip	965.4482
aramis anxious and negligently dressed said	1309.2278
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the	9596.2842
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their	5488.9839
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they	3127.8657
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found	1049.4933
he was a man of execution this worthy	259.7863
dartagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of	738.3305
leu and followed him	146.7010
as dartagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been	673.1843
dartagnan entered behind	117.9041
porthos went and leaned against the side of a	314.8729
dartagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other	1003.0723
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of	581.2297
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the	1515.6964
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the	787.1350
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the	2726.3550
during this time porthos played	2791.5491
then she cried	8221.6748
porthos paid no	299.7772
nevertheless he understood it all but was	266.8324
leu being not far from that	1777.2302
amid all this dartagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of	1103.5232
the sermon over the procurators wife advanced toward the holy	6122.1953
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand	475.8721
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the	1391.6482
this was too much for the procurators wife she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and	1076.0876
porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred	296.2342
cried he is that	25.2243
how is your husband our dear monsieur	1303.5485
is he still as stingy as	363.7600
where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the	518.7309
porthos pretended to be	1558.8218
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have	217.3313
monsieur porthos said the procurators wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five	676.3484
i have something to say to	50.1215
eh	5846.0977
magloirea littlefrequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each	9487.9766
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at	5335.7246
i	108.3244
said porthos drawing himself up proudly how	1505.6821
the signs just now and the holy	1135.3217
but that must be a princess at leastthat lady with her negro boy and her	2213.3416
my	15.9808
madame you are deceived said porthos she is simply a	427.9242
porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman	651.3926
coquenard had seen	216.7653
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a	564.3396
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur	624.8148
resumed the procurators wife with a	557.5920
good lord how quickly men	1047.6354
cried the procurators wife raising her eyes toward	1121.5491
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it	815.6265
the comtesse de monsieur porthos be	466.6521
you are right madame and i will not	174.1138
but it was my husband who would not hear of	692.4890
madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my	1564.5907
the procurators wife uttered a	1783.9114
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather	697.4684
madame coquenard i gave you the	5219.4795
the procurators wife shed a	10584.6328
fie madame	1160.8188
said porthos as if	5909.2866
let us not talk about money if you please it is	607.0637
then you no longer love	98.1695
said the procurators wife slowly and	2342.3113
porthos maintained a majestic	1660.7328
and that is the only reply you	170.7280
alas i	20.9746
think of the offense you have committed toward me	1577.8052
it remains	3602.2944
said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it	487.7729
i will repair it indeed i will my dear	313.2254
besides what did i ask of	57.6156
resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good	781.5754
a loan nothing	12808.2490
after all i am not an unreasonable	288.2704
the procurators wife was	5819.7856
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well	483.2390
hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of	289.0157
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between	1884.0540
ingrate that you	49.4951
i advise you to	401.3125
said	24.6358
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no	360.8375
and she is not to be despised in my	216.9401
now monsieur porthos once more and this is the	245.9958
do you love me	108.7899
cried the procurators wife bursting into	1950.0591
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more	991.2131
rather say that you have a new	168.3763
not so i speak frankly to	107.0895
no object affects me and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for	663.9967
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to	523.1133
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my	5865.3750
porthos observed a last struggle between love and	2289.0645
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in	4926.8013
have you no friends in paris then monsieur	157.1240
said the procurators	3446.2747
i thought i had said porthos resuming his melancholy air but i have been taught my	738.5211
you have	52.3868
cried the procurators wife in a transport that surprised even	1442.5663
come to our house	179.7478
can you recollect all	175.3944
perfectly	108.3246
come at	204881.7656
very	244.6467
and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventysix	4986.6929
seventysix	3193.5354
thats a fine	463.8380
replied	24.6358
a great age you mean monsieur	407.8596
fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes	2417.5508
yes	1398.6660
we are then reconciled dear monsieur	993.0767
said she	153526.5000
for life replied porthos in the same	293.4279
till we meet again then dear	777.1845
till we meet again my forgetful	36629.2734
tomorrow my	418.6040
tomorrow flame of my	768.2766
chapter	113.1170
dartagnan and the englishman dartagnan followed milady without being perceived by	450.8546
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to	604.3292
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful	866.8354
dartagnan therefore returned to the rue	87.7242
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in	414.7671
de trvilles stablesone for himself dartagnan and one for planchetand bring them to athoss	3329.5957
once for all trville had placed his stable at dartagnans	1005.4590
planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and dartagnan toward the rue	1651.1785
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for dartagnan and grimaud obeyed as	347.0464
how young this dartagnan	384.6196
said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another	459.3712
what	25443.6211
asked	36.8714
well and what are you going to do at	93.5904
then demanded	6088.4253
not at	54.9059
said	20.7309
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is	596.3565
well perhaps you are right said	88.8966
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once	373.7722
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is	239.7086
all my researches have been	8214.2061
what is to be	20.3546
i must divert my	3961.8552
amuse yourself with milady my dear dartagnan i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse	412.4125
hear me athos said	38.0601
my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any when i have none i go	528.8386
so au revoir dear	4523.5454
au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just	617.7763
dartagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to	188.8944
all along the road what athos had said respecting	898.4436
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young	111.2282
meantime he was going to try to find out	212.9754
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew	292.8774
now in the opinion of dartagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off	376.9651
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the	166.7773
he had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years later louis	554.5422
was	19209.2422
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with	1859.9946
planchet recognized him	145.5094
eh	185.0368
said he addressing dartagnan dont you remember that face which is blinking	1499.1313
no said dartagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that	224.5941
parbleu i believe it is not said	127.5732
so it	17.1282
said dartagnan i know him	58.0290
do you think he would recollect	114.0447
he could not be mistaken milady was in	253.0797
dartagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being	492.6186
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her	1034.5116
for my	91.6405
replied planchet	63.5572
yes and	3354.2925
take it	163.7870
planchet turned and returned the	1549.4080
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young	589.6204
for	130.0698
said dartagnan are you sure of	73.6321
pardieu monsieur i cant be more	146.8871
the soubrette said for your	3865.6636
i have no other master but you soa pretty little lass my faith is that	7545.8345
well planchet how is the good monsieur de	1166.6838
he is not dead	46.3998
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the	580.1735
well done	161.5656
you are the king of	190.8546
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the	804.9688
this did not take	157.2392
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still	3045.5264
dartagnan thought this was the moment to	290.1833
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very	625.0812
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of	503.8697
ah excuse me then said	157.4502
you must be aware that i was ignorant of that	249.1762
what is that stupid fellow troubling himself	3603.3320
cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach	1378.8647
why does not he go about his	381.2325
stupid fellow	161.9877
i do not go on because it pleases me to stop	344.7852
the cavalier addressed some words in english to his	1676.6849
i speak to you in french said dartagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same	306.5168
you are madames brother i learnbe it so but fortunately you are not	2242.2556
the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at dartagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on	1647.0665
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated	1573.6471
ah said the englishman is it you my	150.2878
it seems you must always be playing some game or	536.5588
yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to	239.6385
we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice	713.1183
you see plainly that i have no sword said the	316.3739
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed	664.9834
needless said the englishman i am well furnished with such	1302.7710
very well my worthy gentleman replied dartagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this	598.7208
where if you	40.8754
behind the luxembourg thats a charming spot for such amusements as the one i propose to	726.7773
that will do i will be	29.6651
your	30794.6523
six	2937.5762
a propos you have probably one or two	730.1690
i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with	693.9139
that falls out	59012.7578
three is just my	598.0628
now then who are	28.9640
asked the	41.4640
i am monsieur dartagnan a gascon gentleman serving in the kings	400.7274
and	98.4007
i am lord de winter baron	5315.1309
well then i am your servant monsieur baron said dartagnan though you have names rather difficult to	546.7422
and touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to	1401.8275
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence dartagnan went straight to the residence of	641.3503
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to	365.1789
de	1424604160.0000
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an	491.0547
we might say that was his	249.9744
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the	696.9956
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of	1424.1530
chapter	135.7641
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to	1524.6086
the lackeys were ordered to act as	600.1929
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the	800.0897
then according to foreign custom the presentations took	3777.9275
we cannot fight with such names they are names of	632.9837
therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said	961.1575
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the	1235.9551
that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our	1307.5968
one plays with anybody but one fights only with	2651.0305
porthos and aramis did the	124.1783
does that satisfy	67.8453
said athos to his	166.7509
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with	423.5678
yes monsieur said the englishman	102.9430
now shall i tell you	83.5900
added athos	1228.9547
replied the	41.4640
why	36.7080
the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the	706.9823
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we	324.4522
answered the englishmen and the frenchmen as with one	219.1663
on guard	23.3707
cried	36.8714
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing	2099.7866
porthos abated no doubt of his toogreat confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and	7408.2314
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in	2329.7854
athos killed his adversary	2766.4194
dartagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de	412.4265
what the devil would you have me do with	88.7898
said the	41.4640
you can restore it to his family said	370.6103
his family will care much about such a trifle as	751.8423
his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from	1219.0426
keep the purse for your	761.4491
dartagnan put the purse into his	284.5307
dartagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of	511.5105
at this time athos came up to	202.4351
what do you mean to do with that	91.4488
whispered	71.5366
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear	203.0805
why to	130.5184
why you killed	134.0710
they are the spoils of	3177.3740
i the heir of an	256.1297
said athos for whom then do you take	107.9760
it is the custom in war said dartagnan why should it not be the custom in a	259.7293
even on the field of battle i have never done	318.4770
porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed	1731.8986
then said dartagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to	336.3760
athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the	83.4334
for you and your	279.7225
grimaud bazin mousqueton and	460.5031
lord de winter on quitting dartagnan gave him his sisters	2833.4685
dartagnan appointed eight oclock at athoss	2834.8577
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon	5694.4883
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his	1237.3538
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of	1183.1705
then she knew that he was one of the friends of	125.4893
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and	249.0337
it is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at	546.2349
dartagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athoss and according to custom related everything to	625.9888
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of	931.6289
dartagnan felt the truth of this	190.7746
i loved madame bonacieux with my heart while i only love milady with my head said	448.0108
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at	1469.4193
the part she plays	8593.9775
it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told	385.5689
the	153.4100
my dear athos you view things on the dark side	2357.3796
my dear fellow i mistrust	568.0551
can it be	257.1942
i bought my experience dearlyparticularly fair	57853.2461
milady is fair you	265.4936
she has the most beautiful light hair	602.9628
ah my poor	145.7959
said	36.8714
listen to	130.5184
be	5075413.5000
said athos	75.6431
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other	700.3111
he therefore found dartagnan alone and as it was nearly eight oclock he took the young man with	403.6531
milady clarik received dartagnan	295231.8125
thank him then madame if you have any affection for	193.4756
the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single	2958.7390
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her	671.3347
lord de winter perceived nothing of	439.1021
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and	564.8917
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited dartagnan to	911.4183
dartagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge	2377.0598
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second	273.3036
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her	3148.2068
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful	408.5354
that pretty little soubrette whom dartagnan had already observed then came	4145.2192
dartagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to	504.5879
those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of	1977.7186
the conversation took a cheerful	1459.2068
milady appeared to have entirely	866.0724
she told dartagnan that lord de winter was her brotherinlaw and not her	727.9021
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one	627.2327
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not	462.3532
dartagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	11284.7900
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of	871.4722
the hour came for him to	357.1235
dartagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of	789.1415
dartagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening	333.2316
de cavois instead of	3865.1587
de	257.5922
dartagnan replied that he had been sent thither by	373.4157
de trville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as	976.0180
at the same hour as on the preceding evening dartagnan	396.9186
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty that was the name of the	693.5103
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty	955.5057
but as we have said dartagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor	658.4416
chapter	35.5901
his heart beat but not like dartagnans with a young and impatient	621.9735
no a more material interest stirred his	2993.1162
coquenard had	345.5255
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some	895.4471
porthos knocked with his	454.6647
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive	2039.9154
it is my	255.5765
cried the procurators	3446.2747
come in come in monsieur	105.2539
this last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with	1716.7460
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception	666.8625
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos	1813.2322
words might be heard at a distance through all these open	662.3325
we are cousins it appears monsieur	2391.2046
said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane	1207.9940
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony	2175.2417
the cousin was received with resignation that was	330.0301
coquenard firm upon his legs would have declined all relationship with	2621.3350
by the female side i	2953.6135
said the procurator	2971740.5000
this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt	590.6151
it appeared likewise that	2108.1284
oh my legs my poor	415.9981
where are	7.8678
murmured coquenard and he tried to	1192.6976
the hour of dinner soon	862.5618
they passed into the eating rooma large dark room situated opposite the	7294.2046
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful	188703.1094
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six	2671.3503
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by	5191.6738
coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	956.4844
he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his	2272.2996
oh	136.5505
said he here is a soup which is rather	695.5524
what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this	1853.3475
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his	440.6089
coquenard was served first then	403.3778
afterward	325.5350
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient	3983.4465
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost	1728.4427
you are certainly treating your cousin very	13905.6367
the	153.4100
thought porthos this is poor	257.1026
i respect old age but i dont much like it boiled or	4720.6621
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned	2903.6709
coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good	1863.7271
the time for wine	865.3145
coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed	6446.3037
will you eat any of these beans cousin	926.8108
said	325.5350
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice dont touch	812.0253
devil take me if i taste one of	240.5985
murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer	548.1953
there was	62.4945
porthos could hardly keep his	7174.2188
the procurator repeated several times ah madame	64462.4531
accept my compliments your dinner has been a real	1199.5533
lord how i have	184.8321
coquenard gently advised him to be	570.2656
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from	778.0028
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and	1524.9490
go young	112.3906
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator	18712.2930
the clerks gone	47128.0156
coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good	1891.0140
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to	1924.2190
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had	1731.2339
a positive	581204.8750
cried	30.2698
coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast epul	10105.3125
lucullus dines with	50157.2305
and	325.5350
coquenard did not seem to observe	174.7420
this is	128.6983
said porthos to himself i am prettily	1539.3890
he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of	2606.0552
now said he the sacrifice is	357.3668
if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husbands	2238.5432
coquenard after the luxuries of such a repast which he called an excess felt the want of a	952.6864
the procurators wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a	1487.6877
you can come and dine three times a week said	1074.9579
thanks	108.3246
said porthos but i dont like to abuse your kindness besides i must think of my	865.2922
thats true said the procurators wife groaning that unfortunate	8349.6904
alas yes said porthos it is	133.5851
but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur	480.0790
oh of many	764.5810
said	24.6358
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the	855.3528
but yet detail them to	643.9456
why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by	1269.4203
the procurators wife waited	46329.2305
to how	57.7792
said	437.7391
i hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed	5634.0635
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred	2105.6743
i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand	1432.9122
good	866.8788
cried she two thousand	387.4708
why that is a	63.6936
porthos made a most significant grimace	1351.4210
coquenard understood	150.5824
ah	213.9960
said porthos that is what you meant to	82.5659
yes dear monsieur	101.0187
thus for instance dont you in the first place want a	457.2509
yes a	95.3738
well	76.0789
i can just suit	1041.7572
three hundred	312.2854
then put down three hundred livres said the procurators wife with a	1048.2891
porthos	121.6221
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from	551.9971
these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his	5101.4941
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my	533.7832
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have	257.0276
a horse for your	463.2145
resumed the procurators wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my	2531.2769
ah	108.3246
said porthos haughtily do you take me for a	705.7811
but then you understand madame coquenard a mule with feathers and	3860.2593
be satisfied said the procurators	1494.6339
there remains the valise added	4567.7412
oh dont let that disturb you cried	729.3353
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the	2155.4978
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the	738.9285
your valise is then	2577.6106
asked porthos with	5971.6777
certainly it is empty replied the procurators wife in real	1032.0590
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a wellfilled one my	1103.3217
madame uttered fresh	7324.6323
molire had not written his scene in lavare	772.8707
coquenard was in the dilemma of	3944.2834
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of	1079.3246
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad	1392.6572
chapter	359.1512
and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air	747.9440
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the	797.0883
speak my child speak said dartagnan i	126.1577
that which i have to say is too long and above all too	365.3713
well what is to be	49.7104
if monsieur chevalier would follow	1187.0680
said kitty	3256483.7500
where you please my dear	74.7250
come	76.0789
come in here monsieur chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can	337.2600
and whose room is this my dear	264.4165
it is mine monsieur chevalier it communicates with my mistresss by that	1973.8663
but you need not	118.6298
she will not hear what we say she never goes to bed before	475.9214
dartagnan cast a glance around	397.8930
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep	326.3865
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur	1023.3210
said	437.7391
oh more than i can say	1099.0914
i am mad for	260.1993
kitty breathed a second	435.4397
alas monsieur said she that is too	180.5348
what the devil do you see so bad in	148.6621
said	20.7309
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at	3347.2944
said dartagnan can she have charged you to tell me	220.5506
that is to say you dont believe what i have told you is it not	140.9192
we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from	1035.0306
then you dont believe	61.2859
kitty drew a little note from her	684.5334
for	130.0698
said dartagnan seizing the	376.8886
no for	66.0694
for	5029.8027
his name his	7.6559
cried	20.7309
read the	344.3503
monsieur el comte de	105221.8828
the remembrance of the scene at	532.7000
germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous	580.1202
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you	207.7668
said dartagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first	350.6874
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of	791.0882
de	1004988.8750
you have an opportunity now count do not allow it to	289.8138
dartagnan became very pale he was wounded in his selflove he thought that it was in his	262.2419
poor dear monsieur dartagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young mans	955.1974
you pity me little	364.6320
said	20.7309
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in	136.9892
you know what it is to be in	113.9792
said dartagnan looking at her for the first time with much	197.2892
alas	339.7201
well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your	642.1993
and what sort of revenge would you	476.9614
i would triumph over her and supplant my	3518.9548
i will never help you in that monsieur chevalier said kitty	732.6641
and why	23.1360
demanded	20.7309
for two	4569.1216
what	20101.5098
the first is that my mistress will never love	408.5794
how do you know	15.1591
you have cut her to the	243.4787
speak i beg	17.1846
i will never confess that but to the manwho should read to the bottom of my	525.3651
dartagnan looked at kitty for the second	920.4178
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their	10023.6133
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like dont let that disturb	458.8280
and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a	742.5214
oh no said kitty it is not me you	278.7395
it is my mistress you love you told me so just	198.3219
and does that hinder you from letting me know the second	2104.0171
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the	1397.2422
what	4482.3413
asked the young	43.4758
of that which i am ready to feel toward	154.6003
and what is that	103.4140
are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your	441.0337
oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very	9263.9551
nevertheless to dartagnans great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself	4302.7236
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and	3042.8643
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in miladys	1153.6707
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling	1536.5743
go go	194.4072
what are you	16.2706
cried	4901310.0000
dartagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without	609.7353
well cried milady in a sharp	772.4337
are you asleep that you dont answer when i	490.3752
and dartagnan heard the door of communication opened	221.7817
here am i milady here am	82.8162
cried kitty springing forward to meet her	925.1197
she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her	1770.8258
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this	513.6077
what	8885.9785
has he not	43.9694
said	4901310.0000
can he be inconstant before being	1329.8678
oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de trville or monsieur	437.4155
i understand my game kitty i have this one	900.9254
what will you do with him	71.9409
what will i do with	49.8270
oh i will be	243.3466
i believed that madame loved	1492.4098
i love	21.8089
i detest	572.3597
oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond	892.3574
what the mercers wife of the rue des	441.3718
has he not already forgotten she ever	628.3511
fine vengeance that on my	792.0314
a cold sweat broke from dartagnans	476.8573
why this woman was a	312.1124
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was	903.6523
for monsieur de	4397.0791
said	4901310.0000
to be sure for monsieur de	2033.6191
go to bed mademoiselle said milady i dont like	3844.8208
dartagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself	540.2630
oh good	32.7669
said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with	233.6768
how pale you	160.5640
the abominable creature murmured	7287.2520
silence silence	15675.8682
said	4901310.0000
thats exactly the reason i wont go said	592.4525
said kitty	206903.0312
or at least i will	1542.0493
he drew kitty to	877.3325
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much	665.8931
therefore kitty	256397.6719
it was a movement of vengeance upon	598.6906
dartagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the	387.7626
de wardes that provoked her	84534.6875
kitty came in but milady was very cross with	603.9385
the poor girl ventured a glance at dartagnan which said see how i suffer on your	1020.4359
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her	483.4115
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely	11966.6885
dartagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	1852.2936
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was	3007.2788
things passed as on the night	176.5368
dartagnan concealed himself in his closet milady called undressed sent away kitty and shut the	3961.2998
as the night before dartagnan did not return home till five oclock in the	422.7222
at eleven oclock kitty came to	1913.6624
she held in her hand a fresh billet from	2346.9556
this time the poor girl did not even argue with dartagnan she gave it to him at	390.9646
she belonged body and soul to her handsome	2757.2156
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest	200.4970
dartagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this	3655.2312
no kitty you are	848.4588
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her	459.0782
oh yes i know what sort of	247.7195
you told me	25.2988
what matters it to you	611.6922
you know it is you alone whom i	174.6188
how can i know	34.8871
by the scorn i will throw upon	1424.1890
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his	594.2993
i will come and ask mine at eleven oclock this	298.1414
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh	1216.4025
dartagnans plan was very	247.4675
by kittys chamber he could gain that of her	2363.1150
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over	633.6973
he might fail but something must be left to	384.4441
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed give that to	616.9951
it is the counts	97.0630
poor kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter	1590.7458
listen my dear girl said dartagnan you cannot but perceive that all this must end some way or	395.1657
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her	392.6671
said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all	633.4305
for me i well know my sweet girl said	294.4177
but i am grateful i swear to	83.8863
but what does this note	563.4743
milady will tell	35.0659
ah you do not love	73.6447
cried kitty and i am very	446.6029
to this reproach there is always one response which deludes	1648.7174
dartagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great	973.5503
this promise completed poor kittys	91418.9688
chapter	194.3536
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they	2235.8582
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find	526.4951
soon as kitty left him dartagnan directed his steps toward the rue	718.6092
he found athos and aramis	2304.3901
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the	12927.5176
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded	7165.2139
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free	449.7209
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked	607.6869
porthos arrived a minute after	533.3700
the four friends were	1289.5023
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously	818.1577
is it my	635.7770
yes and no replied	92.7598
well but cant you	282.8176
come	185.0368
porthos rose saluted his friends and followed	378.0706
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the	455.5084
what do you want with me my	88.9054
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied	579.8819
a	142.4345
what	889.8041
a	96481.9219
give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor	2303.5244
this mendicant insists upon speaking to you and pretends that you will be very glad to see	646.5510
has he sent no particular message for	772.9620
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from	565.7527
from	333813.9062
cried	79.6394
a thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news i	1142.4717
and rising also he went off at a quick	1068.7281
there remained athos and	114.4008
i believe these fellows have managed their	3333.4814
what do you think	22.5937
said	36.8714
go to my dear athos you have truly inconceivable	558.8971
let it	111.4404
that is to say i visit an englishwomanthe one i	1317.4723
oh	825098560.0000
the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to	1192.1096
i gave you my	653.7838
yes you look there for your outfit i think you	624.4907
not at	54.9059
i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of madame	942.3397
yes i understand now to find one woman you court	304.9469
it is the longest road but certainly the most	580.5833
dartagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained	682.4802
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth dartagnans confidence stopped	698.0070
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow	441.0133
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with	1238.0775
you have asked for	106.7406
said the	97.0829
i wish to speak with monsieur	52.4583
is that your name	92.0897
my very	5286.8257
you have brought me	159.3252
yes if you show me a certain embroidered	1138.0762
that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your	1423.5812
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to	401.6880
perform your duty in camp i will do mine	813.0963
adieu or rather au	990.4742
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript	5212.3960
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of	1204.5193
golden	1828325.3750
cried	79.6394
oh beautiful	4710.8716
yes we are young yes we shall yet have happy	340.9099
my love my blood my	163.0462
all all all are thine my adored	1809.2585
and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the	894.3978
now as dartagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced	996.5765
the	153.4100
ah indeed said	30.0395
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis thats all i can	690.6156
how	185.0366
cried bazin a poem sell so dear as	3034.4170
it is	52.5990
i like	261.9798
a poet is as good as an	443.4166
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of	497.2816
bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my	255.0867
bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went	415.7817
said dartagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in	1388.9374
aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and rebuttoned his	2931.9968
my	285.7933
said dartagnan with great	146.8645
dartagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from	404.3766
ah my yellow horse cried	1472.6537
aramis look at that	190.9175
oh the frightful	16523.7793
said	79.6394
ah my dear replied dartagnan upon that very horse i came to	259.8871
what does monsieur know this	288.2176
said	457.6512
it is of an original color said aramis i never saw one with such a hide in my	424.5188
i can well believe it replied dartagnan and that was why i got three crowns for	404.7857
it must have been for his hide for certes the carcass is not worth eighteen	3498.8867
but how did this horse come into your hands	1010.9940
pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur it is a frightful trick of the husband of our	472.6383
how is that	72.9060
which you are taking back to	119.8896
said	20.7309
replied	457.6512
no pardieu though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow	1240.3896
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in	365.4759
but dont let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your masters	1263.0195
is he at	624.2796
yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill	720.3596
get	14796.8135
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in	756.6490
coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of porthos soon enlightened	991.7133
porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurators wife in the cloister of	1540.2694
the procurator seeing he was going invited him to dinneran invitation which the musketeer refused with a majestic	2548.4563
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of	1475.5778
magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of	1034.0382
alas said she i did all for the	214.7649
one of our clients is a horsedealer he owes money to the office and is backward in his	1563.0411
well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a	1178.1694
there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurators wife seeking to excuse	1484.7594
and porthos turning on his heel made a step to	650.2525
monsieur	24.6358
monsieur	24.6358
cried the procurators	3446.2747
i have been wrong i see	110.3973
i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like	733.0925
porthos without reply retreated a second	921.8857
stop in the name of heaven monsieur	172.4497
cried	437.7391
stop and let us	38.0169
talking with you brings me misfortune said	295.3293
but tell me what do you	78.5988
nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for	248.8226
how should i know what a horse	119.8895
how should i know what horse furniture	632.2018
it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of	663.8013
how	36.7079
asked the	97.0829
this evening	62.1941
coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for	584.9407
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at	992.7249
we shall be alone and can make up our	363.5519
in good	215.2509
now you talk my	94.3415
you pardon	10.9920
we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this	1647.3682
the	153.4100
thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenards strongbox at	4909.4424
chapter	1199.0524
a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dartagnan at last	828.7051
as was his custom dartagnan presented himself at miladys at about nine	704.2975
he found her in a charming	625.7912
never had he been so well	148.8829
kitty entered to bring some	8000.3135
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but	1154.7306
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice miladys	2391.8567
at ten oclock milady began to appear	2485.2952
dartagnan knew what she	259.6154
dartagnan rose and took his hat milady gave him her hand to	309.0825
she loves him devilishly he	7479.7686
then he went	15.6307
it was necessary that dartagnan should find alone the staircase and the little	360.5393
she heard him enter but she did not raise her	467.9584
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed	563.7105
the poor girl under the caresses of dartagnan lifted her	2212.8674
dartagnan himself was frightened by the change in her	439.7947
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a	1076.5568
before daybreak	268.6530
de wardes must take his departure still in	5407.1636
presently they heard milady retire to her	1188.3792
dartagnan slipped into the	1331.9520
hardly was he concealed when the little bell	540.6011
kittys detention was not	1257.0863
what is that	97.7605
demanded	8885.9863
it is i said dartagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de	835.2951
oh my god my	26.5772
murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself	815.2218
well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not	558.1192
count count added she you know that i wait for	153.1586
at this appeal dartagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the	2285.1995
dartagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not	1148.4344
i alsoi love	4774.9053
and she slipped a ring from her finger onto	3711.0901
dartagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with	7637.7539
the first movement of dartagnan was to return it but milady added no	541.2212
keep that ring for love of	432.8066
this woman is full of mysteries murmured dartagnan to	560.2547
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal	391.1501
the monster was	341.6078
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you	968.1354
yes much said dartagnan who did not well know how to	261.3861
be tranquil murmured milady i will avenge youand	51020.8984
said dartagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet	776.1464
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power he hated and adored her at the same	1565.5056
presently it sounded one	449.4941
it was necessary to	252.5447
the next morning dartagnan ran to find	537.2125
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for	741.8860
he therefore told him	216.5084
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your	805.8721
you notice my	3187.3254
said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his	495.4440
yes said athos it reminds me of a family	878.1243
it is beautiful is it	54.8240
said	20.7309
yes said athos	191.0289
i did not think two sapphires of such a fine water	1778.5800
have you traded it for your	1192.3411
that ring comes from	3322.9753
cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong	797.8640
her very self she gave it me last	915.0510
here it is replied dartagnan taking it from his	399.0620
athos examined it and became very	721.0026
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for	302.3316
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this	1260.8113
it is impossible it can be she said	74.6547
how could this ring come into the hands of milady	2452.7498
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two	1649.1869
do you know this	228.6628
said	20.7309
i thought i did replied athos but no doubt i was	300.4150
and he returned dartagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at	732.7406
dont ask me for counsel dont tell me you are perplexed what to	410.1727
but	8193.9971
dartagnan took off the ring giving it again to	671.3837
athos	446.0568
look said he is it not	71.5906
and he pointed out to dartagnan the scratch he had	501.0789
but from whom did this ring come to you	326.5009
from my mother who inherited it from her	362.7175
as i told you it is an old family	295.4939
and yousold	3419718.2500
asked dartagnan	1807.5270
no replied athos with a singular	226.9462
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to	278.9102
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his	375.7222
take my advice renounce this	3719.7534
you are right said dartagnan i will have done with	149.6870
i own that this woman terrifies	360.0900
shall you have the	199.8013
said	36.8714
i shall replied dartagnan and	374.0366
on reaching home dartagnan found kitty waiting for	1209.1223
a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and	1603.0197
she was sent by her mistress to the false de	1699.2067
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with	4136.1641
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next	907.6970
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of	201.5008
i kiss your	4816.7354
comte de wardes not a word about the	5505.4243
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of	365.8998
the heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a	904.8963
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this	1202.9534
the answer to madames replied kitty all in a	2886.2625
cried	8885.9863
it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a	220.8553
then all at once starting she cried my	440.8081
can he have and she	189.9871
she ground her teeth she was of the color of	228.6350
what do you want with	20.1197
said she and why do you place your hand on	273.1714
i	301117.9375
do you take me for half a	249.4645
when i am insulted i do not faint i avenge	773.2260
and she made a sign for kitty to leave the	312.1432
chapter	468.9949
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when	1096.5981
dartagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not	871.4485
dartagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his	1411.8988
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding	1213.6991
she renewed the order relative to the gascon but as before she expected him in	589.5872
this letter was in miladys handwriting only this time it was addressed to	470.2615
dartagnan and not to	50.2621
de	1424604160.0000
he opened it and read as follows dear	630.1511
my brotherinlaw and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in	835.6923
will it be the same this	170.0932
your very grateful milady clarik thats all very simple said dartagnan i expected this	1835.4757
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de	1767.1169
and will you	23.6544
asked	4901310.0000
oh my	21.0990
said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the	330.7646
instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to	835.3079
dartagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of	993.4101
as nine oclock sounded dartagnan was at the place	347.7433
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that dartagnan heard her in the	483.8025
he was	90.6999
i am at home to nobody said milady observe to	1072.6742
the servant went	27.0581
dartagnan cast an inquiring glance at	4611.8447
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of	1733.0734
dartagnan approached her with his usual	577.1088
to the questions which dartagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very	1424.1379
then replied he my visit is illtimed you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will	867.8711
no	13.0559
said	8885.9863
on the contrary stay monsieur dartagnan your agreeable company will divert	1009.7770
oh	136.5505
thought	20.7309
she has never been so kind	172.0860
on	7114.3574
milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual	1893.1017
dartagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her	835.3963
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his	657.8688
milady smiled and dartagnan felt that he could damn himself for that	1010.4850
there was a moment at which he felt something like	386.3251
by degrees milady became more	14553.8984
she asked dartagnan if he had a	371.1697
milady smiled with a strange	401.1998
then you love	20.8391
said	437.7391
have i any need to tell you	71.4603
have you not perceived	160.9479
oh difficulties do not affright me said	1626.2197
i shrink before nothing but	8368.8223
nothing is impossible replied milady to true	293.1559
nothing	108.3246
nothing replied	1355.6840
the	153.4100
thought	20.7309
the note is	1349.5181
dartagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to	2165.2781
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you	212.0107
all that could be required of	268.4823
order i am	38.9845
for	1894.1075
for everything cried dartagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself	854.1435
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to dartagnans	1547.0214
i am all attention madame said	144.9181
you	108.3246
said dartagnan affecting surprise is that possible my	961.8035
good and beautiful as you	250.8104
a mortal	74373.7188
an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the	421.7341
may i reckon on you as an	1557.9604
dartagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to	2191.2844
you may madame said he with	1054.0627
my arm and my life belong to you like my	215.2682
then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she	513.6432
demanded	20.7309
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of	747.3330
dartagnan lifted up his	422.1753
i am ready said	62.4632
you have understood me then dear monsieur dartagnan said	301.5606
i could interpret one of your	707.0925
then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much	857.5086
but on my part said milady how should i repay such a	1357.6597
i know these	8647.4561
they are men who do nothing for	238.1066
you know the only reply that i desire said dartagnan the only one worthy of you and of	139.3380
and he drew nearer to	239.5390
she scarcely	5095.4204
interested	889.8054
cried she	75.1862
well merit this pretended happiness	4757.4556
i am at your orders said	115.2778
quite	45959.0469
said milady with a last	903.9315
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful	770.9573
who told you that i had been	198.8244
said	437.7391
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said	799.9097
so much the	35.5445
come tell me his	84.4726
remember that his name is all my	208.3865
yet i must know his	102.3904
yes you must see what confidence i have in	107.7532
you overwhelm me with	923.3745
what is his	45.0191
you know	9.7725
it is surely not one of my	223.8149
replied dartagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him	1146.4894
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate	315.2722
cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her	957.5673
not if it were my own	597.6235
cried dartagnan as if carried away by his	591.6738
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was	755.8867
i love your devotedness said	8081.5137
alas do you love nothing else in	111.8418
asked	20.7309
i love you also	231.3586
said she taking his	296.2786
the warm pressure made dartagnan tremble as if by the touch that fever which consumed milady attacked	3083.4075
you love me	24.8568
cried	71.5366
oh if that were so i should lose my	613.9686
and he folded her in his	113.6837
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to	926.9341
her lips were cold it appeared to dartagnan that he had embraced a	983.0601
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by	1452.7517
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady he almost believed in the crime of de	1684.0477
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed	696.2230
milady seized the	1050.0701
his name is said she in her	220.5000
de wardes i know it cried	1048.0730
and how do you know	71.7526
asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his	348.5882
dartagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an	386.1155
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know	154.3724
how do i know	19.9012
said	20.7309
cried	8885.9863
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of dartagnans	3194.2725
continued	437.7391
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied dartagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of	2963.6301
thanks my brave	193.7462
cried milady and when shall i be	935.0923
tomorrowimmediatelywhen you	62.2314
milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward	1508.7697
all this was answered by an expression of	305.5780
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be	183.7600
no said she you will avenge me but you will not be	187.8245
he is a	75.7573
with women perhaps but not with	241.9787
i know something of	112.0938
but it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with	444.7345
fortune is a courtesan favorable yesterday she may turn her back	3786.3315
which means that you now	369.0732
no i do not hesitate god	605.9826
milady answered by a glance which said is that	185.8830
speak	76.0789
and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she	1432.7345
oh you are an	62.7867
exclaimed the young	27.7476
then all is	91.7542
said	437.7391
except that which i ask of you dear	112.0311
but when i assure you that you may rely on my	427.1192
i cannot wait till	129.4239
i hear my	380.3484
it will be useless for him to find you	90.5983
she rang the bell and kitty	1165.3561
kitty will conduct you to my	225.2606
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these	1202.9833
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a	573.0547
do as i bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven oclockyou have heard what i	730.1895
it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oclock thought dartagnan thats a settled	1395.1324
milady held out her hand to him which he kissed	160.1714
this woman is certainly a great	2007.5131
i must take	206.6815
chapter	70.1639
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of	681.5322
at length the light	367.9119
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of	551.4228
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in	2005.7649
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over	8193.0439
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward	794.3712
this last thought of love counseled her to make this last	2528.8845
dartagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his	413.4380
it was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently	367.6570
he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the	657.0315
two hours thus glided	2671.9478
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more	4223.4062
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron	1384.5856
dartagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had	7333.9985
you cannot think so dear	237.6359
replied dartagnan but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think	1335.6599
at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited	1128.2932
he shall die then since you condemn	365.3490
said dartagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of	745.4986
this reassured	80.7292
seeing dartagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de	1674.3855
i am quite ready said dartagnan but in the first place i should like to be certain of one	209.9790
and what is	11.7535
asked	8885.9863
that is whether you really love	187.9440
i have given you proof of that it seems to	143.0282
and i am yours body and	486.0928
is it not	23.6529
what have i to	142.0552
why that i may be dangerously woundedkilled	2623.4646
cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert	2568.2336
you would not then prefer a method resumed dartagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat	1497.6575
milady looked at her lover in	310.8672
the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful	732.4559
really said she i believe you now begin to	465.8713
who told you that i loved	92.6247
asked milady	26451.5020
asked	8885.9863
yes	277.8750
and why	7.5787
because i alone know	70.6566
that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he	715.2825
said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really cannot tell what you	2418.6101
and she looked at dartagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves	658.5144
entirely go	15.8067
well i feel as if transformeda confession weighs on my	8188.0752
a	32161.7891
without	3485.7212
then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon	745.8840
dartagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to miladys but she evaded	1147.9812
this confession said she growing paler what is this	699.5611
you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you	2028.1322
no	13.0559
do not lie my angel said dartagnan smiling that would be	815.7075
what do you	8.0716
you kill	50.1172
be satisfied you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned	340.0306
what	2954.0586
what	2954.0586
de wardes cannot boast of	41435.5742
how is	11.7476
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i	316.8364
the comte de wardes of thursday and the dartagnan of today are the same	779.7316
it was almost broad	1741.2225
great	866.8788
cried dartagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and	2945.1794
but milady felt herself denounced even by his	3083.2310
he had doubtless seen	222.5160
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded	1363.6774
ah	4937.8130
cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my	608.4175
you shall	14.6398
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable	1224.5757
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel dartagnan began to recover himself little by	896.9689
scoundrel infamous	50531.3359
howled	8885.9863
but dartagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kittys	2548.8503
dartagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from	2185.7952
every blow was accompanied with terrible	2878.0493
quick kitty	234883.9844
but you cant go out so said kitty you are	1100.5485
thats true said dartagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in thats	495.6019
but dress me as well as you are able only make haste think my dear girl its life and	556.8143
kitty was but too well aware of	117.9284
in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a	723.1966
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the	910.3259
it was	48.1271
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole	2488.5872
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window dont	863.1040
the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	2304.2812
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her	4318.0645
chapter	113.3687
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his	766.9358
holloa	960.2670
cried he what do you want you	236.5618
whats your business here you	1774.4199
dartagnan threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the	1047.9176
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a	440.9502
he then concluded it must be an	608.7578
cried	71.5366
hold your tongue you stupid	1011.6165
said the young man i am dartagnan dont you know	110.6318
where is your	90.2729
you monsieur	15.7094
cried grimaud	2106.3953
ah monsieur it is	213.3225
grimaud contented himself with pointing dartagnan out to his master with his	292.5971
dont laugh my	52.1006
cried dartagnan for heavens sake dont laugh for upon my soul its no laughing	1833.4761
how pale you	160.5640
no but i have just met with a terrible	511.8264
are you alone	170.4352
whom do you expect to find with me at this	146.6816
well	244.6467
and dartagnan rushed into athoss	1229.6071
come	1054.6359
said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be	1507.0232
is the king	162.0107
have you killed the	180.2928
you are quite	1605.6030
come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and	355.5744
well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his	806.0004
said	36.8714
cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his	238.9467
let us see said	32.9267
are you sure that the other is	199.2658
the	14872.7578
said athos in so stifled a voice that dartagnan scarcely heard	271.1982
yes she of whom you told me one day at	510.0735
athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his	423.7268
this is a woman of twentysix or twentyeight	2900.0388
fair said athos is she	86.3695
blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and	1072.1622
tall	744354560.0000
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the	2492.7332
but you say she is	160.0987
she is called milady but she may be	656.1655
lord de winter is only her	787.8736
i will see her	104.7750
beware athos	409.3159
you tried to kill her she is a woman to return you the like and not to	338.8994
she will not dare to say anything that would be to denounce	318.4822
she is capable of anything or	729.8038
did you ever see her	685.7096
no said	13.2381
a tigress a	540924.7500
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of	591.1338
dartagnan then related allthe mad passion of milady and her menaces of	2365.3809
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said	281.9582
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave	131.9456
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me	1321.8109
my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills	433.6524
said	36.8714
do you perchance think i set any great store by	2785.7500
in that case take	390.6323
if you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every	647.4073
mistrust everything in short even your own	4433.1040
in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with	416.3559
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs i will accompany	327.7978
but however near it may be replied dartagnan i cannot go thither in this	698.1852
thats true said athos and he rang the	228.0323
grimaud	1065.5087
athos made him a sign to go to dartagnans residence and bring back some	688.7380
grimaud replied by another sign that he understood perfectly and set	743.3868
fortunately you have the	2355.5764
the jewel is yours my dear	328.5161
did you not tell me it was a family	462.6942
yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told	801.0624
it formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife and it is	1179.9674
then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much	427.9140
i take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous	801.3818
never that ring is defiled	3358.2168
sell it	25.1468
sell a jewel which came from my	463.9688
i vow i should consider it a	1127.1737
pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on	468.0916
athos	121.6219
you are a capital companion dartagnan said he your neverfailing cheerfulness raises poor souls in	10376.5322
well let us pledge the ring but upon one	1465.6868
that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for	131.9082
dont dream it	330.5585
what do i	52.2506
a horse for planchet thats	1979.6831
besides you forget that i have a ring	484.8406
to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought	448.3320
it is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted	798.8336
i dont at all understand you but i believe all you say to be	219.2452
let us return to my ring or rather to	631.8173
well i will take it then said	57.9235
dartagnan dressed himself and athos did the	349.7707
they arrived without accident at the rue des	889.8181
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at dartagnan	394.2695
thats	4901310.0000
said dartagnan to himself and darted into the	113.4650
sure	1988.2854
remember it is you who have ruined	123.3522
yes yes to be sure kitty said dartagnan be at ease my	918.3442
but what happened after my	342.4590
how can i	61.8125
said	4901310.0000
the lackeys were brought by the cries she	375.8065
she was mad with	491.0391
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against	3153.3691
poor dear	209.1644
but what can i do with	45.5867
i am going away the day after	292.5877

help me out of paris help me out of	165.3124
i cannot take you however to the siege of la rochelle said	420.5561
my dear little	200.5824

but	8193.9971
i can manage your business for	248.1383
planchet go and find	99.9357
request him to come here	80.4866
we have something very important to say to	137.3392
i understand said athos but why not	168.1838
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthoss duchess is dressed by her husbands clerks said dartagnan	1510.9656
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux	3154.8010
isnt it so	846.7532
i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i	1217.2107
where the devil will constancy niche itself	17746.5938
murmured	36.8714
and i also said dartagnan i	115.0123
i shall always love you be sure of	101.4021
but now answer	374.7662
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to	339.6676
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one	616.6315
there	2986.9795
oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman	406.3514
no no it is one of my friends who loves hermonsieur athos this gentleman	659.4326
cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an	600.0021
you to be	19.2796
said dartagnan pressing athoss	2577.5601
you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame	666.1843
besides kitty will tell nothing will you	1345.7261
oh my	21.0990
you remind me of my	1238.3531
if he should have known me	276.4057
know you	54.1663
did you ever see that man	183.5455
he came twice to	5727.7500
thats	293.2233
about what	61.3803
why about fifteen or eighteen days	731.7071
exactly	36.7080
and yesterday evening he came	308.6775
yesterday	10207.6445
yes just before you	915.4070
my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of	1107.1045
and do you believe he knew you again	363.6175
i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him but perhaps it was too	1067.0930
go down athoshe mistrusts you less than meand see if he be still at his	4309.8813
athos went down and returned	99.7505
he has gone said he and the house door is	208.1506
well then let us all fly said athos and leave nobody here but planchet to bring us	333.6578
a	1884.9912
aramis whom we have sent	65.0528
thats true said athos we must wait for	185.2617
at that moment aramis	1124.6520
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service	573.4158
i shall be grateful to you all my	204.3684
very	244.6467
then said aramis this falls out very	804.0811
therefore let us	48.5619
we shall meet again in better	231.0617
dicers	5466961.5000
said athos while dartagnan went to conduct kitty	3260.6555
aramis returned home and athos and dartagnan busied themselves about pledging the	9068.3965
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the	983.5566
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers	434.0883
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any	2934.9329
he examined him and found him sound and without	604.5747
they asked a thousand livres for	480.9620
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred	5802.8823
dartagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when	724.1694
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his	1501.1400
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased	1073.9387
said	36.8714
five hundred	20.3811
that is to say two hundred morea hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for	292.4267
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jews	468.3803
go and tell him the ring is his dartagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with	492.2966
reflect	36.8714
ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make	1569.6339
go dartagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his	982.7105
a half hour afterward dartagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any	653.1353
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not	538.3666
chapter	375.1284
a vision at four oclock the four friends were all assembled with	303.0851
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for	483.5456
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal	908.9796
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it	1418.8146
no	241433.6719
thats a snare said athos dont go	626.3106
and yet replied dartagnan i think i recognize the	408.8222
it may be counterfeit said	2328.5671
but suppose we all go said dartagnan what the	220.3923
they wont devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and	1879.3459
and besides it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments said	763.2584
we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance	270.1526
yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a	893.1448
they must be	156.3536
he is right said porthos	411.8385
besides we must try our own	522.7983
bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless	1833.1553
as you please said	50.9190
besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a	311.4611
let us get ready	190.1556
dartagnan	1279.8103
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminences commands and dartagnan unsealed the letter and read	599.4484
dartagnan of the kings guards company dessessart is expected at the palaiscardinal this evening at eight	1195.1896
la houdiniere captain of the guards the	824.2487
said athos heres a rendezvous much more serious than the	1290.3334
i will go to the second after attending the first said	262.2718
one is for seven oclock and the other for eight there will be time for	235.7857
i would not go at all said	216.7031
i am of aramiss opinion said	476.3816
gentlemen replied dartagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his	1322.4421
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to meconstance	2406.1604
whatever may ensue i will	774.5552
if you are determined said athos do	148.8854
but the	403.6819
said	79.6394
you will get me out if they put me there said	183.6265
let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole	755.3091
to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the	347.0515
what do you think of the plan	121.0110
replied the young men in	372.1380
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the	460.9070
i have no horse said dartagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de	226.0700
that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of	319.7026
one of	220.9883
how many have you	147.0780
asked	20.7309
three replied aramis	49.0390
certes cried athos you are the bestmounted poet of france or	4739.0073
well my dear aramis you dont want three	417.1098
i cannot comprehend what induced you to buy	1787.4196
therefore i only purchased two said	477.7176
the third then fell from the clouds i	2231.0530
or his mistress interrupted	885.4572
it is only to poets that such things happen said athos	1022.0079
that which was given to me	494.6664
you cannot for a moment imagine dartagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted	1977.7751
or the mysterious benefactress said	54500.4844
the one you bought will then become useless to	409.4817
nearly	36.7080
and you selected it	907.6681
with the greatest	262.2930
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his	800.9172
well transfer it to me at the price it cost	231.8051
how much did it cost	198.9435
eight hundred	312.2854
you are rich	116.4578
said	79.6394
richest my dear	13.2431
and dartagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his	1403.0184
send your saddle then to the htel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with	514.5552
very well but it is already five oclock so make	510.5643
a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue frou on a very handsome	1094.2325
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very	3666.6060
porthos was resplendent with joy and	787.5641
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english	850.9506
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was dartagnans	5482.4180
the two musketeers met at the	448.3466
athos and dartagnan watched their approach from the	263.9060
the	153.4100
cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there	328.1082
yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at	240.4196
planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters	966.1413
the lackeys	4320.9316
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if	1887.0822
near the louvre the four friends met with	185.4673
de trville who was returning from	417.9879
dartagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to	310.4073
de trville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinals	258.8086
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the	307.1859
de	257.5922
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and	1453.5769
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and	1416.1542
dartagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to	588.3058
if it was	180.8703
his three companions joined	1125.6044
all had plainly seen a womans head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew	1879.5092
if that be the case said dartagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to	841.9604
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her	411.6661
you know something of that as well as i do i	333.7580
and perhaps my	160.9986
added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you	958.0332
half past seven had	495.0385
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time	317.5785
but dartagnan was at the same time impetuous and	479.3614
nothing could turn him from his	456.5633
they reached the rue	626.2646
honor and in the place du palaiscardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their	1435.3364
there only they explained to them the matter in	580.0188
dartagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal	1814.4508
but why has he waited till	387.2159
thats all plain	1023.5836
dartagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities but the women will ruin	271.5120
he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the	410.0575
this smile appeared to dartagnan to be of bad	667.0867
the usher returned and made a sign to dartagnan to follow	391.9729
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among	1102.8583
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a	1721.4504
dartagnan remained standing and examined this	255.8952
he saw then that he was with a	200.8919
dartagnan recognized the	118.3996
chapter	57.8697
monsieur said the cardinal are you a dartagnan from	212.6517
yes monseigneur replied the young	77.6491
that is	28.4560
yes	429.0060
you came through meung where something befell	5697.1499
i dont very well know what but still	253.5625
monseigneur said dartagnan this was what happened to me never mind never	230.5671
you were recommended to monsieur de trville were you	251.8059
yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know	828.9548
monseigneur is correctly informed said	856.0537
since that time many things have happened to	346.8552
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been	815.9813
that is all very simple you had business in	359.0590
monseigneur said dartagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewherethat concerns	8347.0469
i know because it is my office to know	354.6810
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the	833.3692
he went to desire you to come to the	141.7430
you have not returned that visit and you were	206.4993
monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your	2565.2327
how could that be	151.3486
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obeybut too	552.0608
that was the very evening when the abduction of	432.5504
bonacieux took	50.5998
besides you owe me some	328.7800
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the	456.4976
dartagnan bowed with	856.1420
dartagnan became more and more	131.6640
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear	260.1803
sit down there before me dartagnan you are gentleman enough not to listen	448.5923
you are brave monsieur dartagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is still	487.8592
i like men of head and	245.4155
dont be afraid said he	126.6353
by men of heart i mean men of	498.6362
alas	429.0054
replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am	488.0062
i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said	1303.5533
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of	837.6532
now what would you say to an ensigns commission in my guards and a company after the	811.0173
ah	429.0060
you accept it do you	159.2045
monseigneur replied dartagnan with an embarrassed	533.3613
you	12929.2930
cried the cardinal with	63.3759
i am in his majestys guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be	353.1422
monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my	823.4975
you want a pretext do you	738.5417
i	28811.7188
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer youso much for the	2127.8889
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the kings	1834.7040
dartagnan	1981.3159
come reflect and	1745.1542
yes	1054.6359
asked the cardinal with a smile of	131.3274
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed	1554.1577
everything is best in its time	416.4631
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself at present i shall appear to sell	283.5760
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble	442.8839
well let it be then as you have said monsieur dartagnan we shall see each other again after the	383.0361
ah monseigneur cried dartagnan spare me the weight of your	1143.7368
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant	2093.1897
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened	825.3306
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed	556.4955
dartagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to	366.6393
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one	262.8532
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered	617.3699
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for	225.5402
dartagnan went to take leave of	125.8143
de	257.5922
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of	430.8792
dessessart and the company of musketeers of	54.3364
de trville who had been accustomed to associate	1248.1497
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased	847.1648
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be	3557.5535
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme	10661.4648
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated the musketeers hastening to the htel of	359.2654
de trville the guards to that of	73.4520
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his	519.6261
the king was dull and appeared ill which detracted a little from his usual lofty	2113.2583
the procurators wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	1584.0205
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample	4601.9287
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos	3685.9238
the musketeer was introduced to	186.8659
coquenard whose little gray eyes sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing	2162.6736
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe	1033.3485
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the	837.6807
porthos paid his compliments to	629.9323
coquenard and bade him	995.2445
coquenard wished him all sorts of	3399.6240
as to	206.4821
but the real adieux were made in	1298.0869
coquenards chamber they were	1601.8811
on his part aramis wrote a long	464.2835
to	100.9386
nobody	30832.2383
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next	310.4171
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish	1340.4976
in the meantime dartagnan was defiling with his	1201.5558
arriving at the faubourg	71.3999
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was	265.5766
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and	529.3439
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg	179.8160
antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for	1923.1714
chapter	212.9458
and one of the great military enterprises of the	597.8045
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	1989.7041
of the important cities given up by henry	4160.6851
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la	2347.8467
and bassompierre was	2158.2385
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the	658.9564
buckingham also was pursuing a private	1989.3627
the first advantage had been gained by	586.0728
de	669478784.0000
the comte de toiras retired into the citadel	21932.3086
martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of la	1413.7097
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend dartagnan formed a	837.0247
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at	1159.1036
now whenever the king halted the musketeers	513.3839
everything was in the same	111.1545
the guards under the command of	303.4495
his reflections were not very	4723.5532
as to love the only woman he could have loved was	498.0120
bonacieux and	208.6462
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of	254.6168
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done	416.5273
this enemy was	1576.0427
dartagnan had a quick eye and a prompt	602.3559
this was evidently an	391.4408
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his	349.3205
no time was to be	161.2747
besides courage was out of the question here dartagnan had fallen into an	542.7154
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost	229.9449
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to	759.0837
dartagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his	277.4631
the ball was not a musket ballit was an arquebus	5474.0122
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been	967.6808
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular	902.5998
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the	424.0365
but dartagnan again shook his	41.7232
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such	976.0073
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most	706.7706
ah my poor	64.9965
murmured dartagnan where are	55.4170
and that you should fail	116.4887
dartagnan passed a very bad	550.8060
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any	2358.7976
but dartagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not	833.3724
dartagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was	1422.8274
at nine oclock the next morning the drums beat to	735.0587
the duc dorlans visited the	22501.0352
the guards were under arms and dartagnan took his place in the midst of his	186.2164
monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments	606.0427
dessessart captain of the guards as well as the	169.4708
at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to dartagnan that	269.1432
dessessart made him a sign to	245.2623
thanks my	87.7693
replied dartagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant	779.6090
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this	2033.9216
as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said	237.6163
four men of good will who will risk being killed with	358.2747
said dartagnan raising his	106.3333
dartagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the	1353.0026
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the	2360.7319
there on turning round dartagnan perceived that the two soldiers had	427.0738
he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to	788.3990
at the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about sixty paces of the	1886.7448
they saw no one and the bastion seemed	599.9485
they knew all they wished to know the bastion was	683.8467
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless	1736.4434
dartagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a	854.4706
a ball had passed through his	562.0502
the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the	613.5118
fortunately deceived by dartagnans trick they neglected to reload their	8308.8926
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a	437.9279
meantime dartagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his	983.4587
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged	4620.6191
dartagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his	280.1828
oh do not kill	89.5752
cried the	156.2134
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you	134.3430
is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for	304.0443
asked the young man withholding his	655.5981
wretch cried dartagnan speak	559.5053
who employed you to assassinate	909.2574
a woman whom i dont know but who is called	637.3611
but if you dont know this woman how do you know her	129.7072
my comrade knows her and called her	502.2733
but how did you become concerned in this villainous	2990.9475
he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i	253.1866
and how much did she give you for this fine	604.5580
a hundred	509.4636
well	849.0659
said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth	717.0617
a hundred	509.4636
well that was a temptation for two wretches like	821.6823
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon but upon one	492.0347
what is	11.7476
said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not	607.4722
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	287.8567
but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing	359.4168
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the	558.5345
pardon monsieur	2490.4436
in the name of that young lady you love and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is	240.8471
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman	283.9544
asked	20.7309
by that letter which my comrade has in his	486.4222
you see then said dartagnan that i must have that	129.1605
stop	8194.0039
cried he regaining strength by force of	1459.8792
i will goi will	300.7143
stay where you are i will go	88.5039
dartagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy	1156.4030
dartagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as	1608.3907
then he began to	158.0502
no	241433.6719
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from	631.3292
but what were you to do with that	89.8690
asked dartagnan with	181.0754
we were to have conveyed her to a htel in the place royale said the wounded	392.4005
yes	339.7200
murmured dartagnan thats the placemiladys own	9514.6523
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the	411.9019
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find	810.6484
bonacieux and a convent was not	557.7292
this idea completely restored clemency to his	4193.8457
lean upon me and let us return to the	161.8250
yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me	581.6132
you have my word said he for the second time i give you your	139.1525
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four	769.0458
dartagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he	797.4661
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had	734.0558
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable	875.5045
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon	522.2988
this tranquillity proved one thingthat dartagnan did not yet know	3833.4563
chapter	143.2179
martin and the fort of la pre as on their side the french were besieging la	2885.8369
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his	521.3049
dartagnan	535278176.0000
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite	1246.5092
cried	20.7309
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my	476.0158
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink	327.1581
dartagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their	1185.0931
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this	268.2911
cries of live the	73.5332
live the	16.0743
resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all	528.3990
his musketeers proceeded and followed	222.7391
de trville who detected him at	737.9402
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one anothers	869.3925
cried dartagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner cannot have had time to get	366.3155
can it	52.0403
added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his	114.6891
ah	213.9960
said porthos it appears we are	2083.2124
i hope said aramis there are no women at your	464.8368
is there any drinkable wine in your	28668.8105
asked	36.8714
well	734.5590

yes i know what brand you are talking	554.5470
the wine you	1762.6919
well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with	2113.5679
and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou	1234.1865
said	24.6358
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your	321.6197
on our	143.7704
said the three	169.1550
did you send this wine	624.5073
said	36.8714
no and you	95.1563
no and you	90.2308
if it was not you it was your purveyor said	126.0458
our	7277325.0000
yes your purveyor godeauthe purveyor of the	13319.5645
my	285.7933
no said athos dont let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	2084.4912
you are right athos said	78.6376
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some	2089.0544
and yet you say he has sent you some as from	187.6172
here is his letter said dartagnan and he presented the note to his	289.6870
this is not his	122.7423
said	36.8714
i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the	919.1761
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been	6458.5308
dartagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a	654.4768
dartagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his	754.4716
thou alarmest	1147924.8750
said athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has	1636.9241
look you my	26.2237
cried dartagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my	1855.1035
can this be another vengeance of that	462.8986
it was now athos who turned	274.2609
dartagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following	369.7397
cried he on perceiving dartagnan	186.0571
this is	77.4184
you pretend to pardon me and you poison	133.7322
cried	20.7309
i	4937.8271
what do you	23.7790
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is	312.4965
do not think so brisemont said dartagnan do not think	486.8520
i swear to you i protest oh but god is	727.4507
god will punish	136.0201
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i	902.8382
i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible	5020.7549
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this	865.6161
ah	185.0368
stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have	660.5908
how	472608448.0000
you were going to drink my	500.2972
the two guardsmen courteously accepted dartagnans excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone	3782.5383
planchet said dartagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your	550.1992
let him be interred in holy	1696.5463
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of	717.2648
and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to	2682.5808
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the	287.9905
well said dartagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the	156.4316
athos shook his	6.3923
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is	286.4533
i am sure of	61.7679
nevertheless i confess i still	147.5014
but the fleurdelis on her	1244.3558
she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in	1871.7666
athos she is your wife i tell you repeated dartagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each	1212.3184
yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so	569.3106
it was dartagnan who now shook his head in his	389.6326
but in either case what is to be	322.4517
said the young	27.7476
the fact is one cannot remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said	1221.6624
we must extricate ourselves from this	2797.3467
but	1097.9034
you must try to see her and have an explanation with	200.6598
say to her peace or	1125.2577
i like the means well enough said dartagnan but where and how to meet with	333.3308
time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of	5712.2412
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to	317.7768
yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and	1762.9854
said	36.8714
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us	1035.6774
yes	2160.3298
what	437.7387
asked	36.8714
madame	297.9082
ah thats	26.2033
said	36.8714
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in	608.0217
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious	1611.8879
i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis	4335.3823
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low	462.2571
but take no notice we know all about	202.5977
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very	220.5822
asked	20.7309
you say she is in a	140.9384
replied	24.6358
very	244.6467
as soon as the siege is over well carry her off from that	873.7962
but we must first learn what convent she is	395.8701
thats true said	60.8236
but i think i have it said	61.5584
dont you say dear dartagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for	275.7870
i believe so at	1373.0306
in that case porthos will assist	364.6864
and how so if you	117.7383
why by your marchioness your duchess your	1363.7574
she must have a long	353.5896
said porthos placing a finger on his	1095.2760
i believe her to be a cardinalist she must know nothing of the	710.0496
then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	866.3454
you	79.6394
cried the three	269.0390
and	1097.9034
by the queens almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis	3213.7244
chapter	109.7374
bassompierre and schomberg against the duc	7455.7114
the result was that to prevent	2390.1682
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to	1497.9438
de schomberg on the south from perigny to	38829.0547
so that monsieur watched bassompierre the king the duc dangoulme and the cardinal	855.1134
de	447451552.0000
as soon as this organization was established they set about driving the english from the	1876.2604
the juncture was	20327.9902
but as	44.6902
simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre	2404.0537
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout	8756.6523
but it must be acknowledged this response was but	834.5546
this league was directed against	2153.7871
de chevreuse and consequently the	627.1648
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without	785.1895
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of	883.5526
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be	2798.9531
he would then be lost and france perhaps with	341.0354
all this must be prepared	315.6141
there were also less agreeable visitsfor two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been	1315.5011
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of	253.0003
de trville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the	1130.7300
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the	673.4232
who goes there	616.1774
replied one of the	85.3637
that is not an answer replied	132.0540
who goes	5.5507
answer or we	71.4237
beware of what you are about	149.1796
said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to	373.6830
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said	799.0786
what do you wish	33.4109
who are	8.7473
said the same voice in the same commanding	171.2985
answer in your turn or you may repent of your	2606.9775
kings musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do	344.8420
what	1531.4731
company of	65.0069
advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this	186.1435
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his	583.3797
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced	232.8448
your	797.4738
said the officer who covered a part of his face with his	408.8472
your	797.4738
repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face	1186.2379
monsieur the	16.0743
cried the stupefied	610.4600
your	797.4738
cried his eminence for the third	172.3741
athos said the	98.9483
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew	450.5551
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an	546.2172
we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no	1356.7957
thank god we can keep a	412.4471
the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous	1035.0237
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to	618.3228
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my	481.4124
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and	733.0554
yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in	780.5009
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know	56.9729
the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their	641.5017
a quarrel and what for	260.2533
said the cardinal you know i dont like	860.9973
what have been the results of your	527.7504
said the cardinal knitting his	61.7692
but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the	557.1375
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with	3107.6353
confess you know i have the right of giving	607.7388
i	429.0064
said	36.8714
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his	1199.8428
ah	213.9960
said the cardinal and you monsieur	82.0354
very well said the cardinal and you monsieur	95.7324
the devil	97.9853
said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret	5165.4155
you dont do your work by	5331.9146
and pray what was this quarrel	850.6479
force her	3113.4438
said the cardinal and for what	178.8354
to do her violence without doubt said	615.7753
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were	720.5847
and was this lady young and	104.3212
asked the cardinal with a certain degree of	327.9015
we did not see her monseigneur said	271.4527
you did not see	43.7393
ah very well replied the cardinal	275.9371
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a	573.1342
judge not rashly says the gospel replied the	3782.1992
athos	189.0125
and now gentlemen thats well continued the	214.6448
i know what i wish to know follow	94.1290
they soon arrived at the silent solitary	1264.3115
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the	1541.7228
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to	338.7680
a saddled horse was fastened to the window	1346.2961
the cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar	1019.1638
advance gentlemen said the	103.8224
in the meantime follow	175.4198
the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did	749.9883
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the	218.2741
the host stood at the	133.6668
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a	418.5635
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good	1058.2336
said the	16.0743
i have this said	55.9434
that will do replied the	46.2505
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an	488.2110
chapter	118.2825
now who was that	146.5021
that was the question the three musketeers put to one	195.5916
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to	270.5014
athos walked about in a contemplative	5159.0347
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is	255.8251
sit down and let us talk it	360.2855
murmured	36.8714
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer	1412.2241
he will set sail tomorrow	1371.1556
fort la pointe or fort vasou was not built until nearly years	25445.2695
i must go thither	531.4981
that is to say when you have received my	252.3694
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as	396.3168
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your	362.7473
yes	429.0060
there was an instant of profound silence between the two	527.8898
the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for	656.5939
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the	431.4806
you will go to london continued the	155.4251
arrived in london you will seek	840.1393
frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of	4530.0903
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same	729.7753
all this negotiation must be carried on	1227.9846
i will follow your eminences instructions to the	509.0258
i only wait till you give	183.2783
will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus	435.4622
yes for i have the	86.9964
i must be able to present these proofs for his	596.6130
without	3485.7212
well	429.0060
is that all	292.3557
i will tell him	39.4291
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you	207.7983
thats it said the cardinal thats	83.6449
you have an excellent memory	598.2908
the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great	1260.9940
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady	1551.2577
if he	3981.3767
said the	16.0743
that is not	36.9478
it is possible said	196.6718
well did there not happen an event which saved	1665.3091
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the	284.8089
your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la	3821.2795
precisely said the	26.6456
said	8885.9863
no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be	1286.9880
yes but she would then be the accomplice of an	657.4753
were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clment ever	35561.7461
no for perhaps they were too highplaced for anyone to dare look for them where they	794.6890
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody	1931.5060
you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by	442.6581
asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no	423.2963
i	429.0064
replied	8885.9863
i think nothing i quote a fact that is	886.0651
that is just said	332.0884
what do you require	104.9709
she is found said	294.3274
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of gods	2760.4319
he will be	155.0407
well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now	338.2995
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to	139.6980
that is it replied the cardinal	177.7075
have you enemies	274.3453
asked	1671.2875
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your	1004.3597
who are	22.7340
replied the	11.3105
in the first place there is a little intrigante named	1336.9152
she is in the prison of	480.1971
to a	174.6251
said the	11.3105
yes to a	117.5452
and to	1166.5830
i dont know the secret has been well	653.5063
but i will	42.0512
and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman	313.7807
i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the	273.1905
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame	522.4467
who is	18.2917
her	1438013.1250
what is his	45.0191
oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her	1013.6006
he is the evil genius of both of	336.2248
ah	213.9960
said the cardinal i know of whom you	131.3153
i mean that miserable	4914.2812
he is a bold fellow said the	246.4418
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be	267.8253
i must have said the duke a proof of his connection with	393.2304
a	1369.9851
cried milady i will have	260.1997
so far good monseigneur but	3861.4263
when once in the bastille there is no	395.2313
said the cardinal in a low	123.0470
ah	734.5590
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the	138.1696
an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a	16940.7676
give me paper a quill and some ink then said the	1067.0208
here they are	200.8465
said athos speaking in a low	191.1232
you must be	61.2567
said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we	301.1017
i will say two words about it to the cardinals esquire	978.8438
the rest concerns myself dont be uneasy about	1222.7260
be prudent athos said	173.9135
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool	428.2639
porthos and aramis resumed their places by the	1650.5676
chapter	335.8153
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came	718.7881
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was	573.6532
what has become of monseigneur	369.7050
asked	71.5366
and you what have you done monsieur	96.3059
i have won five pistoles of	627.7156
well now will you return with	145.5800
we are at your eminences	205.2594
to horse then gentlemen for it is getting	441.8214
the attendant was at the door holding the cardinals horse by the	411.0102
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the	431.8065
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her	2334.7666
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to	389.5512
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in	2536.3008
the host recognized	719.5810
go up said the host she is still in her	242.9825
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind	49.4784
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned	929.8115
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his	395.8851
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was	1984.9595
who are you and what do you	31.8884
cried	437.7391
humph murmured athos it is certainly	343.5722
and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward	619.6607
do you know me	80.4831
said	71.5366
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a	619.7904
so far well said athos i perceive you know	261.0723
the comte de la	1085.2817
murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any	5633.1987
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal	145.5443
milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a	2562.8582
you certainly are a demon sent upon the	829.9872
said	36.8714
you have once before thrown yourself in my	1153.7576
i thought i had crushed you madame but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated	1393.5094
milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed	1147.2330
yes hell has resuscitated you continued	1293.4498
milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed	1359.9041
athos remained	4204.9233
you believed me to be dead did you not as i believed you to	128.7444
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married	735.6147
our position is truly a strange one continued athos	807.3105
i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of	374.8427
you know what i have	46.4777
a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of	706.6473
milady was	147.3482
you must be	7392.0771
cried	437.7391
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to	258.4090
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinatedi care very little about	1250.3311
i dont know	7.1505
besides he is an	112.1664
monsieur dartagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone monsieur dartagnan shall	2168.3726
is it possible to insult you	165.3506
said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall	528.1463
he shall	14.6398
replied milady she first and he	361.0463
athos was seized with a kind of	535.7767
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful	638.2388
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of	2908.4197
with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew	1731.3240
nevertheless she remained	2349.9702
you have one second to decide said	249.8657
take it said she and be	150.4169
and he left the chamber without once looking behind	419.3925
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they	429.2411
as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of	643.9053
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the	829.1434
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his	142.3559
who goes	5.5507
cried he as soon as he perceived the	149.7927
that is our brave musketeer i think said the	350.9236
yes monseigneur said porthos it is	142.0136
monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have	428.9737
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the	159.9767
the watchword is king and	9979.1846
i know it said athos coolly since here it	754.7939
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following	773.7103
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was	776.7947
chapter	186.7883
the bastion saintgervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends dartagnan found them assembled in the same	660.1260
pardieu gentlemen said	38.2637
ah why were you not there	265.1473
it was warm	952.8182
said	36.8714
oh	136.5505
said dartagnan comprehending the slight frown of the	2502.7305
it appears there is something fresh	2795.7039
aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot i	431.7894
how did you	257.8653
for my part i ate but	446.1787
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but	458.7263
what said athos no fish at a	1511.5010
but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied	147.5161
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted	312.8018
why i think there were not many	1481.8313
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the	296.8770
let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of	857.1002
porthos followed chatting with	1806.8737
on their way they met	743.5815
athos made him a sign to come with	163.9070
they arrived at the drinking room of the	928.0150
it was seven oclock in the morning and daylight began to	296.0455
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be	527.5878
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private	891.3015
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their	4686.8525
dartagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours	509.4784
ah yes said a lighthorseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped	838.6803
well said athos dont you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a	479.1237
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know	593.8083
have you not taken a	278.0903
said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer	792.7675
yes monsieur said dartagnan bowing we have had that	543.4861
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly	1349.2568
and what bastion is	176.8244
asked a dragoon with his saber run through a goose which he was taking to be	4969.8584
the bastion	925.3659
gervais replied dartagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our	4667.9082
was that affair	8529.7178
yes moderately	30432.4316
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or	560.2040
but it is probable said the lighthorseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the	2139.5732
yes thats probable said	916.0520
gentlemen said athos a	284.9466
ah wooi a	525192.0625
cried the	93.3958
what is	10.5801
said the	44777.1641
you cursed	203.8572
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable	2846.3604
you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with	28953.6836
said the	79664.2266
now for the	1381.7528
we listen monsieur	49.0287
yes the	2582.4502
said the	44777.1641
gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge	746.4006
porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to	135.0495
but said dartagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without	328.2639
we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not	759.2049
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache thats a fair bet i	1924.2327
i take it said	73.1262
de busigny so let us fix the	7537.8223
you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for	444.7582
will that	150.8786
capitally replied	18.7190
de	659069312.0000
perfectly said the	7303.2397
that shoots me said the	3458.2224
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the	410.9959
well bring it said	241.1365
the host	224.0328
but where are you going to eat my	291.0867
asked the	17.3052
what matter if you are paid for	265.3030
said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the	1310.4669
shall i give you the change my	187.6326
said the	17.3052
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the	1792.2185
which you please	127.2272
said the lighthorseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds half past	8571.7793
thirtyfive minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than	1925.6995
and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion	646.2733
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are	161.9846
why you see plainly enough we are going to the	333.9807
but what are we going to do	42.0641
you know well that we go to breakfast	109.1511
but why did we not breakfast at the	721.7355
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb	373.9916
yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in	4738.3750
a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find	885.1305
better then pursue our enterprise from which besides we cannot retreat without	1867.3011
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the	642.6409
either we shall be attacked or	283.6311
moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with	1526.7686
you see that everything is to our	211.6284
yes said dartagnan but we shall indubitably attract a	1948.3600
well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the	324.3146
but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our	716.1508
you are stupid friend	458.8580
why should we load ourselves with a useless	2659.9844
i dont find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an	1824.1061
well replied athos have you not heard what dartagnan	165.2865
what did he	27.2304
demanded	24.6358
dartagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many	1001.2407
what	76.0789
the bodies were not plundered were	402.7307
it appears the conquerors had something else to	515.0727
oh	36.8714
said aramis truly you are a great	326.0206
porthos nodded in sign of	777.0577
dartagnan alone did not seem	658.4315
where are we	34.6537
asked he by a	152.5858
athos pointed to the	285.1091
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins	582.5550
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward	102.4990
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	410.2836
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a	639.8605
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on	223.3459
grimaud	138.4322
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the	1853.1443
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned	226.7853
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth	16966.3613
athos took off his hat placed it on the end of his sword and waved it in the	258.1573
chapter	141.6869
we can talk while performing that necessary	11519.6162
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies cannot hear	1073.6465
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their	913.5917
yes said athos thats grimauds	431.1631
well then cried dartagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the	895.4630
heaven	777092032.0000
said athos they may serve	334.0522
these bodies serve	6430.8794
said	24.6358
you are mad dear	49.0948
judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied	1788.6917
how many guns	27727.1250
twelve replied	28.2649
how many	20666.0957
a	483.7661
thats quite as many as we shall	218.3703
let us load the	3112.6482
and now to table said	745.5355
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even	4220.9058
i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said	750.0208
but the	262.6000
said	20.7309
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last	442.1417
you saw your wi	68389.7578
interrupted	36.8714
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like	645.7610
i have seen	430.4948
demanded	20.7309
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red	413.9163
in that case i am lost said	105.8259
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of	878.8645
dartagnan breathed	208.0960
but after all asked porthos who is	542.3312
a charming	213.0215
said athos sipping a glass of sparkling	2531.1213
villainous	10687.3232
cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no	1179.4083
by demanding my head of the	268.5775
cried dartagnan pale with	119.3384
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own	746.7281
i also said	391.8782
then said dartagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle	1502.5508
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be	366.2571
but i can never escape said dartagnan with such	316.4953
well said athos that only makes four and we are fourone for	869.4927
what is it	59.0611
considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak my friend but be laconic i	1151.3597
what do you	18.7207
a	38912.6836
of how many	988.1362
twenty	11299.9316
what sort of	78.1661
sixteen pioneers four	871087.6250
how far	16496.2422
five hundred	338.4667
we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health	581.1455
to your	27.6295
repeated porthos and	27.0649
well then to my	127.3132
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to	175.0402
said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his	567.3848
porthos aramis and dartagnan followed his	153.0203
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their	866.7297
said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and	7963.4404
i doubt that replied dartagnan for they are advancing very	649.2994
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with	1878.8317
thats because they dont see us said	180.3677
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of	2054.0686
he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for	926.2789
in truth said athos aramis is	308.5296
i will warn	181.2784
what the devil are you going to	65.1797
cried dartagnan you will be	130.4359
but athos heeded not his	4579.9849
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at	512.9753
take care	891.3031
cried dartagnan dont you see they are	310.0179
yes yes said athos but they are only civiliansvery bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit	1710.9152
grimaud said athos still on the breach another	2326.2175
grimaud immediately	664.2776
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the	1289.6241
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead the rest of the troop took to	1033.7029
now gentlemen a	1143.6349
cried	36.8714
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our	309.8472
where were	43.9713
whither goes	156.0570
added he strongly interested in the route milady	2048.6370
she goes into england said	3605.9756
with what	355.5790
with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of	2233.0432
dartagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and	267.1133
but this is	148.8644
cried	71.5366
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about	176.3516
grimaud obeyed without	2489.2019
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four	1916.1523
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the	1000.3163
replied dartagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be	1005.9208
but the duke is our	89.0956
the duke is english the duke fights against	1221.4719
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty	915.6882
a moment said	136.1459
i will not abandon buckingham	827.5524
he gave us some very fine	525.4630
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his	735.3044
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a	1425.5145
but this creature must be a	778.5312
said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a	638.1740
and this carte blanche said dartagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her	10228.3135
no it passed into mine i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a	353.5879
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my	259.7994
then it was to go to her that you left	132.0887
said	79.6394
and you have that letter of the	57.2570
said	20.7309
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his	276.6035
dartagnan unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read	1570.0457
richelieu in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to	569.8024
that paper must be torn to pieces said dartagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of	934.7415
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved	485.9055
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold	1027.6923
and what will she do	59.1682
asked the young	27.7476
go	130.9685
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said	738.3337
i do not jest said	136.8282
what says the	162.7112
asked athos	1233.5476
i say i am entirely of porthoss opinion replied	531.4981
and i too said	82.5870
fortunately she is far off said porthos for i confess she would worry me if she were	647.8740
she worries me in england as well as in france said	762.6948
she worries me everywhere said	7262.7192
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang	2089.7908
said	24.6358
it is only the dead who do not	158.1214
you think so	34.6272
replied the musketeer with a sad smile which dartagnan alone	372.3663
i have an idea said	68.1901
what is	10.5801
said the	45.2674
to	6441.5898
cried	321.0379
the young men sprang up and seized their	1025.4850
shall we return to the	342.7440
said	24.6358
i dont think the sides are	759.3472
impossible for three reasons replied	537.0714
well then said aramis we must form a plan of	572.8058
thats very simple replied	376.9364
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon	1402.0227
if they continue to advance we must fire	796.1595
we must fire as long as we have loaded	855.4621
cried	24.6358
gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his	1309.2764
i cover mine said	1337.7633
and i mine said	100.9985
and i idem said	594.9114
fire then said	26.0115
the four muskets made but one report but four men	1173.2853
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging	2276.1960
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same	2262.3486
with every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not	1092.0598
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the	286.7313
now my friends said athos finish them at a	384.4835
to the wall to the	315.4560
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the skyand all was	1213.0782
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the	174.2177
said	36.8714
my faith it appears	381.4924
said	20.7309
no cried porthos there go three or four limping	1951.2644
these were all who were left of the little	352.8847
athos looked at his	37.4044
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won but we will be fair	747.0394
besides dartagnan has not told us his idea	362.1689
and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the	522.2325
my	2950.1143
said	20.7309
yes you said you had an idea said	114.7600
oh i remember said	32.5539
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find	205.2333
you shall not do that dartagnan said athos	310.4919
and why	23.1360
have i not been there	132.6552
yes but at that period we were not at	449.6663
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an	799.1910
what you would now do amounts to	695.3600
dartagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was	356.7319
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my	160.6506
silence for monsieur porthoss	5589.6479
said	79.6394
well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur	890.9190
for	7414.0688
said	79.6394
kill a	62.7004
no listen to me i have the true	153.6348
let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young	1521.3306
we must inform the	403.6370
ah my faith	611.7007
said porthos and dartagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it	260.9060
inform the	10.9245
said athos and	105.4162
have we relations with the	903.9730
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the	936.0059
as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon	1060.3102
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos	1412.1116
well do you not adopt this means	306.3982
said	20.7309
without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of	1120.9044
gentlemen said dartagnan what porthos says is full of	408.1397
ah	213.9960
but whats going on in the city	1152.8876
said	36.8714
they are beating the general	881.5406
the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached	598.7645
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said	488.2694
you dont think of holding out against a whole regiment do	820.9648
said	24.6358
why	294.9123
said the	97.0829
upon my word the drum draws near said	1086.8157
let it come said	141.3219
that is more than time enough for us to devise a	897.6793
if we go from this place we shall never find another so	1208.9961
ah	8194.0039
i have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to	319.2005
tell	2525.6250
allow me to give grimaud some indispensable	492.3687
athos made a sign for his lackey to	380.4651
oh the great	112.8314
cried	20.7309
i comprehend	2201.3340
you	28811.8008
said	24.6358
and do you comprehend	169.3090
said	79.6394
grimaud made a sign in the	116.7170
thats all that is necessary said athos now for my	169.1177
i should like however to comprehend said	514.9057
that is	47.7682
yes	339.7200
athoss	26321.6309
cried aramis and dartagnan at the same	122.3308
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brotherinlaw as i think you told me	649.2697
there is no harm in	47.0077
if he detested her it would be all the better replied	556.1668
in that case we are as well off as we	256.5331
and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is	281.2333
silence	24.6358
said	79.6394
what is her brotherinlaws	4862.3530
lord de	31.7507
where is he	36.2888
he returned to london at the first sound of	314.7587
well theres just the man we want said	427.6564
it is he whom we must	615.3757
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of the repentant	1370.1223
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in	494.1555
yes said dartagnan till she comes	238.4976
ah my	150.9473
said athos you require too much	284.6077
yes but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to	227.9074
i answer for bazin said	485.0103
and i for planchet said	91.4108
ay said porthos if we cannot leave the camp our lackeys	739.0021
to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said	357.5879
give the lackeys money and they will	517.5183
we will give them	79.6538
replied	36.8714
have you any	178.4718
look	3509.7146
cried dartagnan i see black points and red points moving	5330.9790
why did you talk of a regiment	148.5725
it is a veritable	653.4758
my faith yes said athos there they	407.2924
see the sneaks come without drum or	24607.6152
ah	213.9960
have you finished	439.1798
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in	882.6792
said athos that does honor to your	607.2336
all very well said porthos but i should like to	136.7189
let us decamp first and you will understand	1100.9363
a moment gentlemen a moment give grimaud time to clear away the	755.7264
ah	213.9960
said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly	3293.6526
i am of dartagnans opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our	1398.1532
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a	491.0887
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a	539.7874
nothing can be said let us be off gentlemen let us be	96.0949
grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the	763.9101
the four friends followed ten paces behind	250.0156
what the devil shall we do now	193.4563
cried	36.8714
have you forgotten	331.5282
said	79.6394
the white flag	632551.1250
we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a	1072.1884
but athos might be said to bear a charmed	751.9241
the balls passed and whistled all around him not one struck	861.5218
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the	651.9784
on both sides loud cries aroseon the one side cries of anger on the other cries of	1480.1075
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a	1835.3978
cries were heard from the camp come	491.5303
come	17511.8105
athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with	493.6285
come along athos come	503.2684
cried dartagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be	468.2209
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the	447.6177
at the end of an instant they heard a furious	920.9213
whats	541.6255
asked porthos what are they firing at	303.9584
i hear no balls whistle and i see	2983.0994
they are firing at the corpses replied	950.0880
but the dead cannot return their	794.0098
certainly	294.9123
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much	4079.6306
oh i comprehend now said the astonished	311.0936
thats lucky said athos shrugging his	1480.4908
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of	753.5202
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the	1468.8035
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos how many have we killed of thema	9986.9160
or	67900.7344
how many did we crush under the	555.2418
eight or	25.3444
and in exchange for all that not even a	457.3721
ah but what is the matter with your hand	95.5152
it bleeds	383286624.0000
oh its nothing said	132.3874
a spent	314.3795
not even	224.4710
what is it	18.2088
that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos	1856.1327
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a	302.1801
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a	672.3271
stop a	184.5515
said	79.6394
well thought of porthos this time you have an	372.3375
undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athoss compliment as there is a diamond let us sell	724.2281
but said dartagnan it is the queens	300.9947
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied	1391.5751
the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more	2208.7087
the queen saving us her friends nothing more	5078.9160
let us sell the	205.2073
what says monsieur the	327.6234
i dont ask porthos his opinion has been	677.1674
my dear aramis you speak like theology	2014.0868
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied	516.2325
well then said dartagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about	962.2021
the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their	3174.9355
my faith it was time that idea came into porthoss	1314.4208
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this	394.8796
we are observed they are coming to meet	124.3534
we shall be carried in	445.9185
in fact as we have said the whole camp was in	432.7847
nothing was heard but cries of live the	405.6210
live the	73.8853
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was	565.5176
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the	1099.3871
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	1349.6868
asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinire	2846.3958
did you inquire the names of those three	392.9069
yes	429.0060
what are their	193.7060
messieurs athos porthos and	23.4151
still my three brave	1740.9211
murmured the	16.0743
and the	324.6265
still my young	31571.4707
positively these four men must be on my	350.6086
the same evening the cardinal spoke to	243.3016
de trville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole	374.2244
thats well monsieur de trville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to	477.1168
i will have three fleurdelis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a	884.7896
monseigneur said	16.4241
de trville that will be unjust to the	366.1958
monsieur dartagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur	1026.4913
that same evening	100.8047
dartagnan was beside himself with	110.4943
we know that the dream of his life had been to become a	350.0622
the three friends were likewise greatly	1458.2672
my faith said dartagnan to athos you had a triumphant	484.5078
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest	774.4761
that evening dartagnan went to present his respects to	367.2988
dessessart and inform him of his	308.9459
dessessart who esteemed dartagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for	5412.7046
the next day	26.6831
dessessarts valet came to dartagnans lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand	2358.8606
this was the price of the queens	243.6187
chapter	36.8950
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family	5690.7314
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal a family affair concerned	655.1113
people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the	865.6677
therefore athos had invented the phrase family	3463.0869
aramis had discovered the idea the	762.9724
porthos had discovered the means the	373.1464
no we were mistaken he had discovered a purchaser for his	1363.3062
the breakfast at	91.2396
de trvilles was as gay and cheerful as	599.0576
dartagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeers uniform in every street of the	1207.8800
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends	185.3569
everyone offered his	1729.1738
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his	1111.4954
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary	2323.8318
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his	3727.7009
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities	1039.2686
but where is such a lackey to be	341.3164
not to be	193.2457
cried	36.8714
i know it well so take	144.3164
take	457.6512
take	27531.7441
take	448.9578
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the	1143.2520
monsieur abb you are a great	250.4885
thats wisenot for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the masterfor the masters we may	3043.0471
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for	1066.0428
my faith said	170.0611
i would almost answer for	585.5242
why good	81.9183
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from	387.5889
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess	548.7165
what the	37.2227
we are not	152.7959
to reach englandathos lowered his voiceall france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be	4988.1538
really i think the thing very	225.1472
said	36.8714
of intrigues and secrets of state continued dartagnan complying with the	1310.3724
i will write to him then nearly in these	573.0700
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical	864.0569
monsieur and dear friend ah	212.5667
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos well	1252.8119
bravo	20.7309
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the	1266.4064
well	3915.3845
i will say then monsieur quite	524.0123
you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for	2459.9353
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the	996.1756
good the	292.8166
one might believe this is an allusion to the	1597.1005
thats ingenious said	372.2053
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was	885.8665
my dear dartagnan you will never make anything but a very bad	1024.7415
where your life was	900.6217
for	7414.0688
thats	3293751.7500
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such	436.4956
a benefit reproached is an offense	44915.2227
the	153.4100
said dartagnan you are	95.4252
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the	2504.6431
and you will do	44.1534
handle the musket and the sword my dear	162.5157
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to monsieur	2398.0442
thats his	10875.4668
ay	825098560.0000
said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in	3471.3435
well so be it said	76.1929
i have heard here and there that this sisterinlaw was a	1335.9879
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the	412.0308
sacr	552088512.0000
said	36.8714
but continued aramis the details escape	1302.3915
and me also said	84.0815
dartagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in	158.3972
repudiated by her husband said	316.5547
because she had been branded continued	1622.1993
cried	24.6358
what do you saythat she wanted to have her brotherinlaw	2709.9021
she was	141.7953
asked	79.6394
and her husband found out that she had a fleurdelis on her	770.6471
cried	24.6358
these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder	6306.0137
and who has seen this	1445.7595
inquired	79.6394
dartagnan and	192.7685
or rather to observe the chronological order i and dartagnan replied	1388.1256
and does the husband of this frightful creature still	775.8174
said	79.6394
he still	923.3129
are you quite sure of	66.4805
i am	28.7542
there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his	569.8701
the	153.4100
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult	281.4756
never	81669.0625
be silent i will	369.7766
but the third time which is the present you may	998.3445
your relative left la rochelle for england during the	649.0069
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible	698.7593
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left	896.5883
well now that will do wonderfully well said	425.6034
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of	368.6282
have you the	186.6544
continued	36.8714
i have what is still	238.2592
i have the price and dartagnan threw the bag upon the	311.8817
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos	571.0820
as to athos he remained	625.2067
how much in that little	781.9090
seven thousand livres in louis of twelve	3031.3828
seven thousand	372.6857
cried	24.6358
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand	1071.4973
it appears so said athos since here they	335.2324
i dont suppose that our friend dartagnan has added any of his own to the	348.9724
but gentlemen in all this said dartagnan we do not think of the	153.7268
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear	955.0125
that is the least we owe	287.1984
thats true said athos but that concerns	332.3928
well replied the latter blushing what must i	290.2448
oh thats simple	34.4008
replied	36.8714
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at	1660.1588
my dear	516.2141
ah	213.9960
said	36.8714
this clever person is your relative	547.6429
go on to your cousin	157.8126
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the	713.7327
i will even venture to say that i am certain	264.5811
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great	1929.1855
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to	913.5194
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded	3483.6208
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear	653.5618
i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was	819.6180
be assured then of seeing me soon	540.6733
cried athos you are the king of poets my dear	312.4877
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the	579.5902
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this	173.1164
that is easily done said	266.5746
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote to	1012.2457
michon seamstress	10174499.0000
the three friends looked at one another and laughed they were	728.5004
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to	371.7191
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him any other person would	2394.5625
very well said dartagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me	520.4806
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his	3196.4424
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are	878.2449
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and	418.5982
will that	150.8786
my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the	2190.4443
well then said athos it is	204.2660
planchet and bazin shall	312.2663
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am	569.4863
yesterdays affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him	1293.8451
planchet was sent for and instructions were given	373.3830
well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said	368.3372
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart	613.3012
dartagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell	185.5820
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a	505.9219
take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good	791.0557
oh	185.0368
said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the	961.3881
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you	498.5336
ah	185.0368
ah	185.0368
planchet began to	646.1324
dartagnan took his	43.9800
listen said he to	41.9980
be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in	412.4434
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his	954.3309
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	2174.8413
the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was	1069.2537
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier	312.0254
good	866.8788
cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de	1087.6622
what does you mean by boor	3790.7756
said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter	379.7850
the	507809088.0000
aramis read the letter and passed it to	164.1358
see what she writes to me athos said	158.3917
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken	296.3462
marie michon and what dream does she	646.7656
asked the dragoon who had approached during the	1290.0873
yez whats the	1482.6519
said the	93.3958
well	734.5590
said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to	277.3422
yez yez said the swiss its simple enough to dell a dream but i neffer	6926.2568
you are very fortunate said athos rising i wish i could say as	596.9819
neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him	905.3589
neffer	727497344.0000
dartagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went	997.9518
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the	979.5367
the days of expectation are long and dartagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were fortyfour	1150.9102
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of	3722.9226
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by	1057.0928
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and	798.7643
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary	2323.2891
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you	239.3413
and what does it amount to after	278.6538
to be	644.9086
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was	1130.4598
to be	3371.2930
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be	718.7655
but if he does not	77.5696
said	20.7309
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed thats	356.5748
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon	1043.1803
life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher counts with a	888.0941
be philosophers as i am gentlemen sit down at the table and let us	1654.6274
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of	1938.0747
you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful	341.8600
a woman of	2373.8870
said porthos with his loud	333.0293
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it	505.4861
the bars were filled with	2832.8713
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the	6774.4688
he had found in	61.4046
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his	2296.2437
they were playing together as usual when seven oclock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the	1016.1712
at half past seven the retreat was	679.2006
we are lost said dartagnan in the ear of	161.0809
come gentlemen said he they are beating the	824.0605
let us to	242.6104
and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by	383.2206
aramis came behind giving his arm to	316.8049
cried dartagnan beside himself with	120.5258
repeated aramis and	18.3458
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in	388.8801
he promised to be back by eight oclock and eight is	183.4798
oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur	230.2325
at the same time dartagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his	495.2409
i have the note said he to athos and to his	116.5249
thats well said athos let us go home and read	120.5977
the note burned the hand of	552.7022
dartagnan translated this for the	2137.4868
i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said	1555.9619
cried dartagnan tell us all about	176.1847
dame thats a long job	1898.4224
so be it said	62.9222
go to bed planchet and sleep	685.5461
my faith	64.9436
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen	510.1092
and me	131.4443
said	20.7309
and me	131.4443
said	24.6358
and me	131.4443
said	79.6394
well if you will have the truth and me	126.3540
said	36.8714
chapter	415.7730
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept	5908.7173
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre	6701.5610
add another day for landing and that would make	587.0322
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary	764.3732
four large vessels recently built had just been	9051.1592
it was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when england remembers that there is a	710.6874
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight	2773.5601
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the	1081.0027
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous	1071.0953
when they entered the port it was already	412.5256
the air they breathed was heavy damp and	1291.0040
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of	1611.1564
the officer desired to have miladys packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the	904.2466
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his	655.5500
milady looked at this man and	227.5840
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my	649.6410
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young	618.7424
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect	315.1068
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing	1004.1357
i will follow you then	86.7850
the officer followed	154.5549
said he to the	94.8243
in five minutes they gained the	249.8242
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to	1365.3573
a carriage was in	140.1394
is this carriage for	126.2368
asked	8885.9863
yes madame replied the	55.2035
the htel then is far	752.2903
at the other end of the	125.8636
very well said milady and she resolutely entered the	1687.3064
houses were no longer to be seen trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one	1746.9033
milady	491.7931
but we are no longer in the city sir said	231.3228
the young officer preserved	20434.2324
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking	337.1296
this threat brought no	1578.1897
oh this is too much cried	294.9991
no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a	612.5338
the young man remained	161.6847
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself	324.7510
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in	687.6182
milady reseated herself	2644.5361
then you dont know me	58.9244
it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing	141.7182
and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against	271.6946
none i swear to	20.7396
there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt	1279.3905
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and	3222.9167
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of	717.9838
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach	1419.8947
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the	361.1999
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	1482.3436
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the	944.7932
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is	290.5964
where am i and why am i	53.6256
if i am free why these bars and these	1127.7280
if i am a prisoner what crime have i	564.7471
you are here in the apartment destined for you	207.8682
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this	305.0506
and who is that other	75.9591
asked milady	1606.1505
can you not tell me his	109.0983
at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the	918.9390
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the	1291.1569
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the	284.3086
he was without a hat carried a sword and flourished a handkerchief in his	648.6573
yes fair	824.9844
replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i	1740.5227
but this castle	84.5825
is	4569.7056
this	34250.7383
is	941.6439
i am then your	142.6760
nearly	36.7080
but this is a frightful abuse of	555.8738
no highsounding	1667968.3750
let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to	974.1990
then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he	248.8153
all is well i thank you now leave us alone	289.0197
chapter	460.8312
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be	253.2830
why did he detain	564.7544
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been	861.4635
this supposition appeared to her most	1997.7507
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the	385.4289
milady replied to this question by another	490.5233
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to	202.4335
ah to see	29.8553
said de winter	16480.9727
to be sure to see	28.1871
what is there astonishing in	147.5398
and you had no other object in coming to england but to see	269.3828
so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the	511.3485
for you	80.6488
the	215.5083
what tenderness my	1660.4573
but am i not your nearest	864.1085
demanded milady with a tone of the most touching	1773.8024
and my only heir are you	152.8294
said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of	637.5356
in fact the blow was direct and	559.2181
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak	401.2417
what do you mean to	14.2299
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your	3655.4683
oh my god	27.0187
said lord de winter with apparent good	798.3432
you wish to see me and you come to	85.3959
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told	129.8428
no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my	414.8086
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear	147.1616
i am commandant of the	1404.5728
they brought me that	1314.5343
i recognized your name in	125.9690
you know the	304.6386
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more	720.8922
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de	302.9770
my friend the	36.5190
cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well	1135.1171
is he not your	110.6853
replied the baron	4240.8745
ah	4520.0566
i thought so but we will return to my lord duke	431.1073
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had	1525.6588
you came you say to see	78.8880
am i then to remain here	688.3060
demanded milady with a certain	1073.2145
do you find yourself badly lodged	700.9351
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with	198.5178
but i have neither my women nor my	325.8907
you shall have all	74.0635
my first	684.0965
cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their	744.6996
yes your french	333.1838
i dont speak of my	269.0131
a cold sweat burst from the brow of	443.0868
you	46809.6797
said she in a hollow	316.9023
do i look	346.6965
asked the baron rising and going a step	1036.7817
i insult	134.9279
said lord de winter with	188.5423
in truth madame do you think that can be	266.6748
indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or	806.1511
leave the room and send me a	210.8050
women are very indiscreet my	612.0269
cannot i serve you as a waiting	441.0434
by that means all our secrets will remain in the	454.5507
said	71.5366
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people but i warn you i shall defend myself even against	464.1166
you are right said	168.7202
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a	652.2601
there are here no procurators who regulate successions	10113.9990
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	586.7982
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your	799.3690
were you not already rich enoughyou who possess nearly a	2630.0403
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity	1052.2618
milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed	1980.1617
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this	349.7309
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid besides your window opens immediately over the	2458.8931
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to	616.3945
the order is	1806.9324
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it	1098.6141
i see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its	6258.2349
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty	277.6721
i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to	1618.0299
i have an infernal	1643.3802
i shall meet with a	365.4518
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from	499.7989
ah try	110.2028
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know	333.9761
what do you say of	29.7271
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more	1401.5475
if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon	369.9166
he went toward the door and opened it	289.9617
call	159736.8750
felton said	15.9389
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to	537.5012
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the	458.6053
the young officer	187.9832
now said the baron look at this	260.3875
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly	2681.2495
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill	450.9017
i am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a	236.8059
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my	1217.3953
i hold this serpent in my	934.4109
swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has	2784.8879
john felton i trust your	1762.8248
john felton i put faith in your	2426.8196
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a	1855.1416
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the	561.3950
that is sufficient my	131.6734
i have	8880.5898
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by	595.5409
milady let her head sink as if crushed by this	1897.8331
lord de winter went out making a sign to felton who followed him shutting the door after	692.2040
chapter	729.1781
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and	1031.4615
with anne of austriafor that affair was overbut he had to adjust matters for	3610.5076
de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc	12614.5957
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing	418.1449
in one case or the other the trial was soon	358.3755
the cardinal pronounced the single word	1746.2954
the king was invited to come and see the	530.8127
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the	1989.1833
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not	2349.0862
the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a	341.2032
the rochellais then had no hope but in	2108.8704
buckingham was their	9641.9131
in the first place la rochelle appeared	1948.1490
had she betrayed	332.5033
was she	91.4745
that was what he could not	97.3605
and yet he reckoned and with reason on	512.4741
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la	1486.1045
henry	8553.4053
when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the	13440.8760
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the	836.8244
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and	10149.6064
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just	499.2110
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the	1870.0509
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these	1901.9308
it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this	2660.2988
cried	321.0379
you are speaking you	665.3916
said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming	2062.2073
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with	829.6809
the cardinal seemed	1708.2429
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said	1025.4639
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior	2408.6987
grumbled the	16.0743
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are	793.1218
athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of	819.1660
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by	731.5606
the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a	299.6601
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your	477.3735
said the	16.0743
you look like four	9209.1475
only we conspire against the	15249.6787
ah you gentlemen of	480.2532
the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his	319.1832
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real	2577.1877
and if it were an	2088.8096
replied the	16.0743
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied	1545.9823
thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to	206.4202
what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly	577.5341
a womans letter	3074.0383
the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his	713.0625
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and	1342.5927
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were	813.4259
well	244.6467
said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in	625.0326
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over	1280.7034
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red	483.9465
adieu	873.2681
and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode	847.1099
then they looked at one	114.9420
athos alone smiled with a selfpossessed disdainful	3524.6914
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad	734.5769
cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his illhumor on	2097.6248
grimaud was about to reply to excuse	316.8810
athos lifted his finger and grimaud was	465.3263
would you have given up the letter	185.6483
said	20.7309
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my	751.9072
i expected as much said athos and that was why i threw myself between you and	395.7501
my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after	738.4474
how in the	178.4466
said	36.8714
whose then is the air we	499.6504
whose is the ocean upon which we	439.3250
whose is the sand upon which we were	1215.0151
whose is that letter of your	144.9793
do these belong to the	152.7205
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to	491.1737
there you stood stammering stupefied	57636.2734
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into	1201.2246
is being in love	4711.8242
thats a match you are playing with his eminence this letter is your	577.3075
why should you expose your game to your	770.1089
that is never	307.4821
let him find it out if he	205.5394
we can find out	294.9618
well thats all very sensible athos said	463.6624
you had only read a line or two said dartagnan read the letter again from the	722.8594
willingly said	14.8872
meanwhile she is not very wretched what she most desires is a letter from her	501.8558
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal	537.7442
adieu my dear	158.4505
i embrace	374.3917
marie michon oh what do i not owe you	518.8528
said	20.7309
dear	2484381.7500
i have at length then intelligence of	417.6957
she lives she is in safety in a convent she is at	441.9495
where is bthune	1966.0885
why upon the frontiers of artois and of	2673.2910
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that	767.8682
poor	7491.5122
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all	2370.6101
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave	2798.5940
but what the devil are you about	98.6980
continued	36.8714
why you are squeezing that letter into your	1230.4745
yes said dartagnan athos is right it must be	405.4918
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate	1025.0024
he must have one said	112.5777
what will you do with the letter	71.1374
asked	24.6358
come here grimaud said	98.5369
grimaud rose and	71.2640
first here is the	59.8987
eat	10437975.0000
bravo monsieur	112.2741
said athos and now take	122.0553
thats	244.6467
we dispense with your saying	3598.2119
meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be	3076.9978
chapter	58.1518
dartagnan has conquered herher that invincible power of	20910.9766
dartagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	1155.1823
all this she owes to dartagnan without	1437.1890
from whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from	4633.0269
he knows her	1093.0887
he must have written to	145.2259
what hatred she	174765.0000
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against dartagnanprojects lost in the distance of the	1803.3851
yes but in order to avenge herself she must be	1137.5739
go to go	17.3893
no violence violence is the proof of	618.4274
in the first place i have never succeeded by that	352.0521
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my	358.9875
at length she murmured satisfied with herself come nothing is lost i am still	934.4371
it was then nearly eight oclock in the	146.1166
a better idea however came into her mind before going to	1079.4636
she had heard something said about	881.5292
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a	476.7222
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her	1166.9832
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its	4860.1929
steps sounded in the chamber and drew	432.1712
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of	387.9254
the order was	640.6702
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued	1898.7675
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward	1950.7760
ah	213.9960
said he she is asleep thats	167.2301
when she wakes she can	7720.2793
and he made some steps toward the	251.3425
what not	827.3323
said felton what is she doing	308.6379
she has	573.5233
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her	533.7348
the soldier went out to obey the orders of his	284.1084
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward	1153.7571
she then thought that lord de winter would come and by his presence give fresh strength to her	597.4286
her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her	2643.6206
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed	1265.6458
at this sigh felton turned	4937.3086
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do	383.2670
if you want anything you can	119.2388
oh my god my	26.5772
how i have	166.3161
said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to	2925.9075
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she	1336.0714
felton	986.4612
you will be served thus madame three times a day said	452.7753
in the morning at nine oclock in the day at one oclock and in the evening at	53.7170
but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal	1122.4950
asked	8885.9863
i thank you sir replied the prisoner	548.3762
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the	509.9529
he held a vial of salts in his	2373.6233
well what is itwhat is going on	191.2171
said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go	723.6750
is this corpse come to life	711.0016
milady shuddered through her whole	3730.3186
these words of feltons passed like ice through her	4034.2207
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the	1185.0179
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out	792.9731
oh i will be a match for	63.0185
taste that fowl and those	282.3817
on my honor they are not	420.5996
do as i	69.7636
adieu dear sister till your next	2323.8706
this was all that milady could	1729.9482
the blade was round and of flexible	3904.6267
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the illclosed door and the door	769.3030
ha	2894.8120
cried lord de winter ha	1000.8001
dont you see my brave felton dont you see what i told	999.2832
that knife was for you my lad she would have killed	299.7821
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of	303.9031
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody	1776.1620
see john see how well she knows how to handle a	1827.9878
the knife fell to the	164.4768
and both again left the	109.6554
i am lost murmured she i am	165.4350
it is however impossible that this should end as they have	1174.4165
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution	1681.1401
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to	405.7241
it is useless then to attempt anything with	282.7789
but feltonthats another	1444666.0000
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of	1236.5328
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her	1293.0674
chapter	307.4960
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first	2912.2014
in the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in	301.2029
felton remained in the	197.8330
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first	1063.7502
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long	662.2548
i suffer	5514.5469
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were	289.8720
all i ask is permission to remain	3810.4097
would you like to have a physician	224.6328
said the	61.2814
felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a	2236.4702
go and fetch a	503.3085
said	437.7391
what could be the good of	165.6762
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish	2952.0930
eh how can i	86.1171
my	15.9808
i know that i suffer thats	149.5193
give me anything you like it is of little	294.8005
go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal	2664.1033
oh no	2.8272
cried milady no sir do not call him i conjure	653.5933
i am well i want nothing do not call	205.9409
he has	59.3550
thought	8885.9863
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	328.9445
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not	612.9998
two hours passed	323.0915
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be	281.2750
in the morning when they entered miladys chamber they had brought her	462.5411
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then	987.6195
milady was not	45.2562
felton remained behind he held a book in his	575.5838
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting	2483.5537
bartholomew they sometimes came to seek	1792.2509
my	1593161.3750
and of what religion are you then	235.6045
asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely	854.6866
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had	818.4066
well let my god save me or let me perish for my	239.7588
that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de	193.9956
lord de winter came toward five oclock in the	288.0365
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of	414.7281
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her	619.8159
what do you mean	14.9180
i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your	677.8798
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have	624.7981
then you have no religion at all i like that best replied lord de winter	556.6962
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady	1960.7603
oh i confess it is all the same to	123.5154
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for	2750.3833
what you talk of debaucheries madame messalina lady	12006.5947
either i misunderstand you or you are very	1209.3546
my jailers and my	27535.4453
heyday	108.3246
you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this	643.6128
infamous	1869823.7500
impious	1869823.7500
cried milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his	3746.0081
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going	933.8919
come come calm yourself madame puritan or ill remove you to a	1326.1317
its my spanish wine that has got into your head is it	394.3317
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad	1312.0375
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly	2402.8665
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this	254.8069
milady had guessed	746.2245
yes go	2.4058
silence was	384.6133
two hours passed	323.0915
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around	383.5593
for the moment she wished nothing	347.8727
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only	1250.6804
an hour after her table was cleared but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the	1500.1782
he feared then to see her too	367.9600
while singing milady	12305.0576
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into	1215.7843
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had	407.9825
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and	2554.2266
then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of	1525.6711
what are you meddling with	251.4326
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from	1234.6156
you were told to guard herto fire at her if she attempted to	1765.8864
guard	1226.0890
if she flies kill her but dont exceed your	9815.9023
an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of	2569.7673
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the	1340.6816
why do you sing thus and with such a	383.6000
said	71.5366
your pardon sir said milady with	1498.6818
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this	648.7476
i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i	1714.3860
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was	620.4135
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the	916.9256
no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at	1516.2350
you have done right lieutenant said the	355.4311
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so	949.1519
chapter	449.8057
captivity the third day felton had fallen but there was still another step to be	853.7391
still more must be	45.8538
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might failfor felton was forewarned and that against the least	4621.3770
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more	483.7158
she had laid that down the preceding	605.5728
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would	130.1216
toward midday lord de winter	269.1532
milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it	354.5413
ah	213.9960
said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing	3717.7073
the prisoner made no	278.3145
yes yes continued lord de winter i	222.2849
you would like very well to be at liberty on that	906.7333
patience	126479.2109
yes pray accursed	5428.6528
and he went	15.6307
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to	387.7525
my god my	6.5207
said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to	1529.2000
god of	1169.4760
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be	1233.3011
how do you know i was praying	209.4084
said milady in a voice broken by	951.6536
you were deceived sir i was not	409.7475
god	10.5192
said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last	746.8015
oh my god thou knowest whether i am	1703.9679
oh you are a just	59.4374
cried milady throwing herself at his	818.8458
listen then to the supplication of a despairing	813.9629
you are abused sir but that is not the	524.1212
speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor	3840.3608
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this	1068.7596
to youno to you	3485.7778
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my	568.5591
what do you	23.7790
oh you do not understand	54.9208
when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or	612.0566
would to	194.4082
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or	607.5740
it is i who no longer understand you madame said	341.6753
or rather who pretend not to understand me	445.5623
replied the prisoner with a smile of	157.2209
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a	236.4666
what you are ignorant of lord de winters designs upon	694.6754
i	1454.1849
impossible you are his	387.5321
i never lie	632.3044
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine	547.5681
you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such a	1001.9403
good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a	532.4168
then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of	467.7478
whom do you call that	101.0264
asked	15477077.0000
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be	1124.2505
you mean george	75887.7812
asked felton whose looks became	34399.8164
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied	30431.1543
the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the chastisement he	714.0223
oh my god my	26.5772
do you know him	102.7017
asked	15477077.0000
at length he interrogates	32120.2852
said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great	895.9969
oh know	9.7725
yes	339.7200
to my misfortune to my eternal	347.5981
and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of	1153.1564
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my	677.9302
oh hear me to the	233.4845
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercys for pitys	997.0461
i will embrace your	1498.2831
you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to	719.3642
my	15.9808
to youthe only just good and compassionate being i have met	1687.8905
to youmy preserver	6438105.5000
only one minute	6355.4844
felton and you will have saved my	87.5217
to kill	110.5324
cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill	1491.7716
he knows	32.6056
my god i am	146.6164
felton remained standing motionless and	916.2057
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest	1281.2616
someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de	574.4415
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the	329.2062
milady sprang toward	75.0432
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a	3434.9871
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die	450.1060
then her brow	10487.5098
she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more	1381.3853
oh yes said she smiling but we wont tell	385.6377
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the	412.1917
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my	2289.2031
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause	1088.2765
how dear	116.9000
said lord de	38.0619
well here i am be	163.8201
besides this time my visit has a	450.9755
milady trembled she thought felton had told	3355.6719
she was	156.9127
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside	721.9445
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it	735.3871
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from	708.7777
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be	702.5594
she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and	5933.2124
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than	1384.5289
a	2441.9644
have you a name	155.5667
i bear that of your	625.1545
ay but you are	80.9679
my brother is only your second husband and your first is still	440.1663
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte	327.8261
you will	24.3883
you are	591.3281
well then you must be registered as charlotte	4999.3735
milady remained silent only this time it was no longer from affectation but from	1272.6311
she believed the order ready for	826.2343
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal	753.5400
it is only shown to me to terrify me thats	298.9090
you are	55.0115
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of	221.6769
adieu	108.3246
that is all i had to say to	149.0190
and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are	1261.0403
would you like better to be hanged in your true name	458.3564
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of	599.4318
speak	59306.3008
milady made no reply but became as pale as a	590.0139
oh i see you prefer	1593.3702
thats well madame and there is an old proverb that says traveling trains	1788.6267
my	285.7933
you are not wrong after all and life is	573.5479
thats the reason why i take such care you shall not deprive me of	331.8143
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be	755.3949
you think me rather parsimonious dont	3076.8540
thats because i dont care to leave you the means of corrupting your	2297.9172
besides you will always have your charms left to seduce them	1808.1907
employ them if your check with regard to felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that	1439.1949
felton has not told him said milady to	526.8492
nothing is lost	107.7949
and now madame till i see you	117.8366
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my	222.5822
lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went	484.5614
milady breathed	208.0960
she had still four days before	359.8593
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of	4545.1538
a terrible idea however rushed into her	1045.3843
in that case felton would escape herfor in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was	6568.2383
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured	579.1209
felton had not	213.9808
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers	449.2852
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to	332.2763
it is he said	37.1903
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening	4404.1040
but although her voicesweet full and sonorousvibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained	5729.8535
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient selfcommand not to	1430.7056
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound	1678.1343
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with	977.0237
chapter	12.6781
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than	1724.0693
he asked	704.2227
nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her	824.5781
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that	2258.5156
he started and the prisoner saw that startfor though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped	1097.7695
what were you doing on that	292.2814
asked	71.5366
of what	181.1162
replied	8885.9863
but replied felton i wish to	505.8029
do not question me said the prisoner you know that we who are true christians are forbidden to	354.7068
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns	18151.4570
you say either too much or too little speak	828.5292
in the name of heaven explain	211.1553
no	198.5377
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned	306.1486
you are only responsible for my body is it not	281.3281
i madame	67.7882
cried	15477077.0000
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your	282.2365
oh you cannot believe what you	50.1677
let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady	687.7296
every soldier must be ambitious must he	280.6413
you are a	85.8215
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	220.3309
it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will	254.3395
but do you understand the mission you are	305.8958
i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have	357.1208
do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous	1944.4331
dunce cried milady	47695.4648
impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this	1366.3812
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through	413.7956
milady saw the	922.0976
thy god shall teach thee to	2571.7236
from th abyss hell give ear to my	5937.8823
felton stood before this strange apparition like one	3621.8157
who art	36.8016
who art	36.8016
cried he clasping his	150.1755
do you not know me	383.6155
yes	339.7200
said felton i doubted but now i	721.9807
you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de	843.8946
i deliver you up to	544.4767
what mean you by	53.9085
they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear	368.6384
yes	339.7200
said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last	1573.2352
speak	1054.6339
cried felton i can understand you	535.9827
a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of	2395.0740
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this	403.8975
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned	5230.1826
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my	731.7444
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in	1621.7902
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a	688.9670
let me die that is	106.1275
hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached	3651.8933
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against	4628.5664
you are a christian you are my sister in	489.0109
but cried the young officer speak then	185.9853
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes	1584.6884
i could	245.8566
to me to a	162.2209
said	15477077.0000
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his	653.8954
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he	315.8169
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young	1461.6038
you have been here a very long time john said	751.6896
has this woman been relating her crimes to	633.7553
in that case i can comprehend the length of the	363.9543
felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted	779.9295
ah you fear your prisoner should	395.4306
said	437.7391
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of	1570.7609
you demanded a	1137.4723
said the baron	870.7873
yes my lord replied the young man	132.6600
and what favor	812.9587
asked lord de	38.0619
there is myself replied	451.7292
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de	6126.8911
choose tyburn	4524078.5000
believe me the cord is more certain than the	333.0350
you are right said she i have often thought of	144.1564
then she added in a low voice and i will think of it	242.8643
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this	1741.2723
mistrust yourself john said	714.7537
i have placed reliance upon you my	1730.1620
i have warned	45.2852
you hear	44.2835
felton lowered his head and	420.6938
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i	261.6507
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange	2598.3027
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a	795.1814
as to felton he	29505.3789
ah he is not a man like that cursed	224.6389
a puritan only adores virgins and he adores them by clasping his	25581.8203
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round	1930.2197
milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton	1667.2288
presently the door opened and she perceived	296.7595
what do you want with	20.1197
said	437.7391
listen replied felton in a low	617.9590
the baron has just related a frightful story to	728.1767
milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her	859.4485
either you are a demon continued felton or the baronmy benefactor my fatheris a	6730.2227
i have known you four days i have loved him four	286.8499
i therefore may hesitate between	1753.9780
be not alarmed at what i say i want to be	263.7016
tonight after twelve i will come and see you and you shall convince	255.1900
no felton no my brother said she the sacrifice is too great and i feel what it must cost	590.4022
no i am lost do not be lost with	109.2391
well said felton only promise till you have seen me	776.9778
well said milady for you i will	120.3071
i swear it by our	1013.0120
are you	70.5810
well said felton till	3025.5198
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his	2148.0159
my god said she what a senseless	2286.2273
my god it is iiand this fellow who will help me to avenge	1195.8588
chapter	369.6165
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a halftriumph and success doubled her	7344.0425
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of	4360.7471
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary	8415.6826
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of	1412.4166
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next	2282.7795
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her	2338.0142
poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away twothirds of her	3307.8965
milady was only a queen while among	751.0666
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her	2664.1045
to command inferior beings was rather a humiliation than a pleasure for	1387.2264
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious	2880.3162
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in	788.0172
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the	245.1223
well said the baron on leaving her you will not escape	561.7455
at ten oclock felton came and placed the	1909.3893
milady recognized his	1276.6920
that was not the appointed	123.0906
felton did not	106.8239
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was	1142.4575
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with	500.8818
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the	1322.4332
at the expiration of ten minutes felton	541.0885
milady was all	194.1965
listen said the young man to the	50.6450
yes i know it said the	165.2202
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest	481.4951
murmured milady the austere puritan	11819.5928
as to the soldier he only	202.7074
zounds	2259.6921
felton	1279.8103
if i call come said	67.3581
if anyone comes call	533.9138
i will lieutenant said the	491.9831
felton entered miladys	4797.1519
milady	986.4612
you are	22.0533
said	437.7391
i promised to come said felton and i have	349.2578
you promised me something	172.4935
what my	21.0989
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our	362.1755
say no more of that madame said	643.8445
i have reflected and i cannot must not be guilty of such a	539.7681
ah you have	214.8787
said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain and i also have	695.8248
upon	223.8639
that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his	302.3873
oh my	21.0990
murmured	15477077.0000
you may retire said	951.0824
i will not	214.8853
let me see it said	339.9685
for what	49.7571
upon my honor i will instantly return it to	186.7320
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and	225.9166
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good	482.3157
you are a faithful friend	1130.4589
felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the	450.5909
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of	200.6633
now said she listen to	96.8602
the request was	699.2010
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour	2907.3159
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a	2169.3054
i	60389084.0000
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i	8043.5454
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body	3613.5146
finally milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her	853.2512
finally said felton finally what did they	1595.8734
at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not	3609.0583
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	1968.5668
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange	1976.7731
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against	2059.1995
i	986.4631
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their	878.8532
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its	998.7639
i stretched out my	1675.5037
i tried to	151.6362
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over	2791.0005
i fell upon one knee then upon	1355.4003
i tried to pray but my tongue was	1205.4088
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no	560.7689
no door gave entrance to the	148.5361
it might be called a magnificent	632.0587
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself	697.7768
i arose	2547.4067
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to	2077.8789
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste	8899.3945
i was no longer in the house where i had	167.8546
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already twothirds	741.4780
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twentyfour	1106.6248
what had taken place during this long	1356.7148
yes it was a prison for i tried in vain to get out of	346.0626
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an	1121.9519
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors	3006.8918
i did not know but i had better remain where i was	408.2199
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every	798.7845
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling	1260.4939
all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me	591.0253
murmured	15477077.0000
oh yes	2051.5647
oh yes	2051.5647
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was	2758.6384
your	9072.4365
adieu my charmer i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better	957.4131
at these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and	2749.2649
i found myself again in complete	1073.9424
but who then was this	117.3236
asked	15477077.0000
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my	1440.6628
day came the table had disappeared only i had still the knife in my	443.0716
this knife was my only	386.2126
i was worn out with	1824.0121
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes i had not dared to sleep a single	962.4981
when i awoke a fresh meal was	2228.5850
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring	1073.3977
it was fortyeight hours since i had taken any	1392.2568
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of	823.5725
but my fears were this time illfounded i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i	1854.5189
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be	1052.2794
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more	1192.4475
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into	1649.4473
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the	312.5491
suspicion instantly seized	2159.4133
i paused but i had already drunk half a	1063.6659
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my	860.3785
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i was	892.5582
felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole	5567.5322
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less	235.1748
i wished to make an effort i attempted to cry	693.8355
tell me who this man	85.0157
cried the young	53.1322
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge	1034.7045
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal	959.0443
this desperate resistance could not last	1133.0167
felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of	2409.7371
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his	1004.6016
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to	1338.7479
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you	103.9815
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy	315.8349
the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it	1402.1565
cried	15477077.0000
yes said	1171.1602
in short what shall i say to you	404.6539
continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a	491.9747
continue	3209.5039
said felton i am eager to see you attain your	1030.9354
oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as	338.4817
i had no doubt he would return the following	612.7321
during the day i had nothing to	41.8978
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and	781.3130
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat	466.7997
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the	345.5956
several times even i felt a smile on my	595.6767
felton i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled you would hold me in horror go	367.9384
go	783.0089
said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the	357.8617
evening came the ordinary events took	666.5129
during the darkness as before my supper was	372.3709
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to	654.9725
i only ate some	7667.3691
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of	809.7112
two hours passed away without anything fresh	4137.9517
oh my	21.0990
who could have said so the evening	283.8595
i began to fear that he would not	192.9237
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own	630.8889
i implored heaven that he might	1454.9374
said felton do you not see that each of your words burns me like molten	2106.1660
the miserable	1542.5677
he had foreseen	101.8473
his breast was covered with a coatofmail the knife was bent against	1471.8414
ah	213.9960
but thats more than dislike thats	3926.5090
come come calm yourself my sweet	1648.3944
i thought you had	599.8444
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by	1707.6697
you dont love	30.6500
with my usual fatuity i doubted it now i am	1635.9393
tomorrow you shall be	63.0893
i had but one wish that was that he should kill	249.5398
said i for my liberty is your	225.4929
explain yourself my pretty	12165.5273
yes for as soon as i leave this place i will tell	186.4928
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward	772.7092
i will describe my	2613.5991
i will denounce this place of	1951.0886
you are placed on high my lord but	602.1330
above you there is the king above the king there is	136.3603
however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape	1507.2180
then you shall not leave this place said	126.1439
very well cried i then the place of my punishment will be that of my	259.5342
you shall have no weapon left in your	513.9466
i will allow myself to die with	262.6000
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as	502.3880
and i will say that you are the	368.2791
said my enemy in a jeering tone thats quite another	2119.8660
my	285.7933
everything considered you are very well off	234.0628
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own	338.2720
at these words he	350.6129
he kept his	408.6977
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him	259.9942
but i also kept my word with him and i neither ate nor	743.3318
i was as i told him resolved to die of	225.6931
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my	609.5948
the second night the door opened i was lying on the floor for my strength began to abandon	512.9782
at the noise i raised myself up on one	303.0839
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized	806.5933
are we softened a	360.5303
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of	799.9955
come take a little oath for me on the cross i wont ask anything more of	802.5750
said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet	463.2302
i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of	783.7426
he saw that it was a merciless war between usa war to the	2078.0493
said	71.5366
i give you the rest of tonight and all day	522.8958
cried	277.8750
to interminable ineffaceable	382740928.0000
repeated	277.8750
oh i declare to you felton i thought him	918.8456
yes yes	48.0161
replied	71.5366
oh leave	22.5443
said	277.8750
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your	389.2031
very well it is your own	173.2853
till tomorrow evening	111.1962
till tomorrow evening	111.1962
replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with	1250.6798
chapter	1221.0881
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk	1223.3530
i suffered frightful	944094.2500
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was	3510.8096
in the midst of one of these swoons i heard the door	698.0906
terror recalled me to	863.8748
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a	246.3527
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of	187.7040
you have said puritans have but one	385.8227
you persist	44.3288
i swear it before the god who hears	450.5959
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an	643.3354
you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of	1144.3303
then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your	331.0266
oh his name his	56.0547
cried	15477077.0000
his name tell it	214.5000
a burning fire a redhot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my	1945.6240
felton uttered a	222.7753
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust	810.3632
but cried felton that is a fleurdelis which i see	1078.1858
and therein consisted the infamy replied	20008.5410
the brand of	30836.0898
oh by that by that i was branded	684.7911
this was too much for	1362.0787
the brand disappeared the beauty alone	6891.5796
cried felton oh	11116.1416
milady read in his eyes	251.3734
pardon for	135.4452
asked	437.7391
pardon me for having joined with your	1059.1509
milady held out her hand to	62.2123
so	6247.9419
so	4387.2563
cried felton covering that hand with his	4493.2119
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a	390.6532
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	431.0255
he no longer loved her he adored	754.2288
i have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true	125.6646
for to me there is but one the other was an instrument that was	120.9585
what	38389.6016
cried milady must i name him	516.1941
have you not yet divined who he	272.3384
cried felton heagain healways	993958.8125
whatthe truly	2170.4043
it is then	430.2375
cried felton in a high state of	1348.2819
buckingham the executioner of this angelic	895.4113
cried	15477077.0000
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my	5754.0898
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us	1038.5774
god abandons him who abandons himself said	3874.2334
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the	722.1204
said felton with increasing	517481.8438
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial	42797.4648
men fear him and spare	185.9206
i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare	415.3682
the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal	2296.2690
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all	937.3030
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an	211.1725
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every	519.8541
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham	1220.9985
yes yes said felton i understand how he would	3376.5442
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the	262.6034
who was then only prince of	537.7194
my affianced husband	14942.9199
lord de	31.7507
cried	15477077.0000
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you	273.4705
buckingham remained nearly a year	2047.4991
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole	1087.9009
whence came the	67.0169
god who knows all knows without doubt but as for me i accuse	860.1463
oh what an abyss what an	981.2776
cried	15477077.0000
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his	2254.8411
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless	5306.0347
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an	868.0213
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my	305.5782
but all my fortune is in	233.9375
communication being closed by the war i was in want of	382.2606
i was then obliged to come back	270.9636
six days ago i landed at	4387.2607
said	15477077.0000
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my	732.2282
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend	323.1245
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your	802.4509
you know the	304.6386
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the	1723.9469
oh the train is well laid the plot is	389.4071
my honor will not survive	686.8519
you see then felton i can do nothing but	1720.0063
felton give me that	908.3539
no no said	35.1269
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your	1696.1395
oh death	35.9348
said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than	1216.3705
felton my brother my friend i conjure	98.6553
no cried felton no you shall live and you shall be	495.7460
felton i bring misfortune to all who surround	349.9102
felton abandon	1478.8370
felton let me	142.4172
well then we will live and die	294.3361
cried he pressing his lips to those of the	240.8253
several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from	992.6700
hark said she we have been	192.8977
someone is	79.1976
all is	80.3440
we are	72.4041
no said felton it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the	587.1520
then run to the door and open it	250.3103
felton obeyed this woman was now his whole thought his whole	614.4744
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a	1186.0559
well what is the	14.1313
asked the young	33.5337
i heard you cry out without understanding what you	319.8476
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the	555.0332
and here i am said the	97.0627
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood	4239.5444
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	404.0443
great	866.8788
exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her	867.8053
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	851.8824
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the	709.0931
ah said he here we are at the last act of the	260.9526
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named but be easy no blood will	5150.4175
milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terrible proof of her	1817.3368
felton uttered a cry and rushed toward	293.4457
he was too late milady had stabbed	5148.3252
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the	1941.2056
miladys robe was not the less stained with blood in a	660.4408
milady fell down and seemed to be in a	305.9856
felton snatched away the	3287.5300
be at ease felton said lord de	994.1213
she is not dead demons do not die so	562.7573
be tranquil and go wait for me in my	281.2292
but my lord go sir i command	108.1501
at this injunction from his superior felton obeyed but in going out he put the knife into his	2508.4055
chapter	293.5239
escape as lord de winter had thought miladys wound was not	1878.3256
it was however necessary to affect weakness and painnot a very difficult task for so finished an actress as	4639.8271
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from	512.6068
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was	1176.8383
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hopeher only means of	1411.9702
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be	3338.7915
she had one hope which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour but felton did not	879.6163
were her fears	14392.3955
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive	1652.9501
she had only one day	137.2125
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twentythird and it was now the morning of the	1316.3533
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for	375.7312
although she had eaten nothing in the morning the dinner was brought in at its usual	447.6389
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was	357.5942
then she ventured to ask what had become of	991.0572
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on	576.0445
she inquired if the baron was still at the	446.6469
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left	343.8635
the soldier went out leaving the dinner	1051.6113
felton was sent	349.7495
the marines were	2154.7292
felton was then	1378.7583
this was the last blow to the	93.0103
left alone she	663.1932
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the	780.5999
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her	1046.8169
milady smiled with	64.8486
she was free now to give way to her transports without being	2017.0479
at six oclock lord de winter came	562.5521
he was armed at all	1001.4431
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable	1008.6191
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate	993.5565
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	596.3201
said he i see but you shall not kill me	156.0670
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my	458.9048
you had begun to pervert my poor	6401.7646
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save	1526.4469
he will never see you again all is	348.8899
get your clothes	406.1124
tomorrow you will	23.7824
tomorrow by twelve oclock i shall have the order for your exile signed	1076.0205
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains	1865.8281
he has orders to do	344.5731
that is agreed	685.4196
au revoir then that is all i have to say	256.8567
tomorrow i will see you again to take my	105.2691
with these words the baron went	413.6231
supper was	347.8497
milady felt that she stood in need of all her	402.7105
the storm broke about ten	814.1384
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her	1235.7424
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her	499.0378
she ran to the window and opened	70.5797
cried	437.7391
i am	228.0551
yes said felton but silence	1700.8004
i must have time to file through these	1281.5842
only take care that i am not seen through the	634.0419
oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied	365.6943
they have closed up the grating with a	554.3788
that is well god has made them senseless said	963.5295
but what must i	41.5238
asked	8885.9863
nothing nothing only shut the	724.4080
go to bed or at least lie down in your	1027.2375
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of	742.7228
but will you be able to follow	74.7774
oh	339.7200
your	349978.1250
gives me pain but will not prevent my	546.6163
be ready then at the first	241.4627
milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the	817.3384
there are hours which last a	373.0309
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped	1140.5105
milady sprang out of bed and opened the	320.7565
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass	782.8973
are you	131.5757

money if you have	50.9385
yes fortunately they have left me all i	364.4594
so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a	1525.7657
said milady placing a bag full of louis in feltons	3583.6714
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the	84.1055
now said he will you	41.0606
i am	67.8673
milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the	600.6121
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of	1629.8877
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a	307.2530
the dark space frightened	4688.5156
i expected this said	1805.6997
its nothing its	217.1957

said	15477077.0000
you ask	151.1419
put your two hands	341.3978
cross them thats	214.6509
felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the	696.1457
what are you	16.2706
asked milady with	693.3959
pass your arms around my neck and fear	943.0400
but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to	351.9562
dont be	66.4767
i am a	165.0177
not a second was to be	170.9277
milady passed her two arms round feltons neck and let herself slip out of the	1429.6554
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by	1016.4382
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the	783.7131
all at once felton	1239.3000
what is the	21.4165
asked	8885.9863
silence said felton i hear	4458.5132
we are	519.7520
there was a silence of several	257.4007
no said felton it is	633.3644
but what then is the	82.2456
that of the patrol going their	855.7529
where is their	335.2454
just under	538.5032
they will discover	310.2484
no if it does not	1025.2728
but they will run against the bottom of the	540.8130
fortunately it is too short by six	562.7917
here they	135.2916
my	15.9808
this was a terrible moment for the	204.6478
the patrol	13194.4893
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died	1280.7144
now said felton we are	1287.1169
milady breathed a deep sigh and	199.9106
felton continued to	625.4702
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his	598.6791
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four	946.9941
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	1195.6935
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was	1567.2482
the little boat bounded over the waves like a	2003.6342
to the sloop said felton and row	5805.5283
however they left the castle behind that was the principal	367.0253
the night was extremely	788.6250
a black point floated on the	757.1681
that was the	2143.6223
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her	3098.3374
milady breathed a sigh and opened her	484.5464
where am	11.7185
said	437.7391
replied the young	53.1322
oh saved	135.7122

yes there is the sky here is the	212.3058
the air i breathe is the air of	502.5430
ah thanks felton	14591.4785
the young man pressed her to his	239.4879
but what is the matter with my	70.3131
asked milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a	1825.5453
milady held out her arms her wrists were	1997.4203
said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head	704.2680
oh its nothing	293.7837
cried	8885.9863
i remember	63.2570
milady looked around her as if in search of	192.7851
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his	320.2875
they drew near to the	1927.1738
a sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat	1168.8549
what vessel is	87.2356
asked	8885.9863
the one i have hired for	273.0263
where will it take	25.7564
where you please after you have put me on shore at	794.1511
what are you going to do at	140.6483
asked	8885.9863

what	8469.1846
asked	8885.9863
you do not	44.2171
asked	15477077.0000
no explain yourself i	133.9766
but if he mistrusted you how could he confide such an order to	519.2040
how could i know what i was the bearer	103.4506
thats	672.4240
and you are going to	95.5287
i have no time to	59.5720
tomorrow is the twentythird and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his	12033.9697
he sets sail	6516811.0000
where	902.1497
for la	19.2044
he need not	1102.5953
cried milady forgetting her usual presence of	7325.1284
be satisfied replied felton he will not	1408.8563
milady started with	181.7147
felton cried she you are as great as judas	2890.8145
if you die i will die with you that is all i can say to	104.4232
cried felton we are	750.8779
in fact they touched the	4801.0645
an instant after they were on the	316.9195
for a thousand pistoles said the	212.2342
i have paid you five hundred of	103.5829
thats correct said the	188.5303
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of	831.7661
and shall we arrive	87.6561
safe and sound as true as my names jack	7291.0684
well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand	732.0847
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in	986.9322
milady knew the	316.2150
chapter	278.9847
felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james	2468.9592
and charles	70.2195
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the	4730.4868
he entered portsmouth about eight oclock in the	573.2783
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with	2293.7476
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and	1358.7581
felton darted into the	131.1314
felton and he addressed patrick the dukes confidential lackey at the same	1996.4519
each was anxious to gain admission before the	1175.5209
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the	461.7249
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said	2793.0137
from lord de	38.0619
repeated buckingham let him come	287.7295
felton	1065.5092
why didnt the baron come	5143.0991
demanded	1303.0059
i expected him this	90.8282
yes i know that said buckingham he has a	364.6928
it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied	288.4263
well then	52.8996
that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my	209.8563
leave us patrick said buckingham but remain within sound of the	1876.2917
i shall call you	197.9050
patrick went	5.1185
we are alone sir said buckingham	380.4923
yes sir and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign	206.8167
here it is my	29.2991
give it to me said the	70.8828
yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the	712.6516
then your grace knows her real	1159.6040
asked felton in a sharp	1117.7437
i know it and the duke put the quill to the	386.9112
felton grew	140.9926
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the	698.0856
doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than	616.1151
i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know	192.1118
and will your grace sign that order without	1269.0317
buckingham looked at the young man	260.3616
reply to them my lord said felton the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps	666.3749
buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and	757.6332
without remorse said	2847.9094
the duke put his pen to the	477.6797
you will not sign that order my	399.7943
said felton making a step toward the	1358.7833
i will not sign this	375.4326
and why	23.1360
because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the	158.4118
i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said	1937.2108
this lady is	450.5987
my lord milady de winter is an angel you know that she is and i demand her liberty of	409.3175
are you mad to talk to me	176.9001
said	1303.0059
my lord excuse	385.9839
i speak as i can i restrain	289.1239
but my lord think of what youre about to do and beware of going too	506.5188
what do you	23.7790
god pardon	10.9920
cried buckingham i really think he threatens	470.8958
no my lord i still	434.6492
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under	796.8268
you will hear me to the end my	114.5540
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled	2534.5210
repair your crimes toward her let her go free and i will exact nothing else from	631.9749
you will	1461.0310
said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	906.3853
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord	1570.1453
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you	424.2106
ah this is too	49.5579
cried buckingham making a step toward the	710.3666
felton barred his	2548.3105
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de	710.8887
remember that she is a woman whom you have	223.9151
withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in	762.3516
beware my lord you are in the hands of	86.6541
in the hands of the devil you	66.0301
cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely	1232.1937
sign my lord sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the	1377.6917
by	839706.0625
you are	92.3845
holloa	568966592.0000
sign my	3.6912
shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his	215.9116
but felton did not give him time to draw	503.3354
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my	1749.9982
from	5730.7114
cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter	2604.4812
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the	534.0296
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed	1509.3958
screamed	568966592.0000
i guessed	58.7728
but too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that i	936.1850
felton made no	158.8284
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the	880.4160
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from	369.5307
yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late	3872.8777
silence laporte you may be	1142.9545
patrick let no one	543.9852
oh i cannot tell what she says to	161.1266
my god i am	131.4541
and the duke	7010.7354
cries of despair resounded on all	1033.4767
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the	1713.7444
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken	1136.6884
lord de winter tore his	613.7298
too late by a	645.5926
cried he too late by a	542.9652
oh my god my	26.5772
what a	117.5586
the duke however was not	408.4703
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all	1708.6299
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporteah is that you de	1134.0571
you sent me a strange madman this	966.3325
see the state in which he has put	227.8198
oh my	3.6912
cried the baron i shall never console	346.7834
and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to	555.4335
the baron went out	1321.3560
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and	1611.7073
a physician was sought for but none was yet	779.1927
you will live my lord you will	116.2688
repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the dukes	458.4230
what has she written to	271.2461
read me her	186.5729
oh my	3.6912
said	3737.7039
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to	185.7124
said he	29.4568
i cannot	31.2535
read	76.0789
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to	353.8903
and is that allis that	785.4062
replied buckingham	10991.7803
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved	209.6099
ah said buckingham god be	4095.0823
my death then will not be to her as the death of a	170.9810
laporte burst into	76.4826
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were	464.4655
patrick brought the object desired which laporte recognized as having belonged to the	734.2015
now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in	3047.9761
patrick again	131.3244
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from herthis silver casket and these two	3455.3083
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of	739.3511
patrick uttered a loud	298.1602
dead	3980.5034
cried	568966592.0000
what have you	63.2516
i have avenged	8628.9541
said	71.5366
avenged yourself said the	198.0365
i dont know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my	475.9014
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such	1598.2478
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of	2438.8562
all at once he	67.2116
his eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea commanded by the terrace where he	730.5298
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the	838.7559
one last favor my	218.3226
said he to the	79.7563
asked his	2290.7383
what oclock is	28.4653
the baron drew out his	1506.7242
it wants ten minutes to nine said	384.9342
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a	248.7318
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be	545.8266
the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the	1139.2360
god has so willed	17988.3516
de winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed	490.1143
be punished alone for the first miserable	838.2921
felton lowered his head without pronouncing a	1185.2361
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the	861.4824
chapter	293.8169
in france the first fear of the king of england charles	200.7420
had made restitution to the united	6476.3374
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set	784.6146
louis at	355.4283
germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty	407.2159
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after	515.8570
de trville for they were the first to whom he communicated	154.2207
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which	780.3945
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of bthune with milady her mortal	2436.1807
bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or	4456.6899
they had not long to wait for an	143.9186
bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of	937.1998
therefore dartagnan was going to ask leave of absence of	203.1779
their joy was	308.7244
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the	551.9955
at length the escort passed through paris on the twentythird in the	655.8311
the king thanked	419.7765
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four	2567.3643
still further athos obtained of	518.8526
de trville postdated the leave to the morning of the	1690.6729
good	1108.0652
said dartagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at	657.2493
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple	441.7879
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	872.7281
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition	694.2009
we can therefore use up four horses as well as	687.0577
if you had only to deal with four men dartagnan i would allow you to go	258.6768
you have to do with that	102.0850
we four will go and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient	578.5283
you terrify me	23002.6465
cried	20.7309
my	15.9808
what do you	35.7175
replied	36.8714
dartagnan who had his eyes fixed upon this man became very pale and let his glass	628.0991
what is the matter	47.0698
said	448.9578
oh come gentlemen my master is	403.0675
the three friends hastened toward dartagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his	447.3085
they stopped him at the	20.8159
well where the devil are you going	145.4198
cried	36.8714
it is	9.3759
cried dartagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is	241.7482
let me overtake	219.7142
what	71.5365
asked	36.8714
he that	122.8341
what	889.8041
i have seen him that is	122.5802
i recognized him when the wind blew upon his	1111.1399
the	153.4100
said athos	108117.2891
to saddle	1812.7972
to	290520.2812
let us pursue him and we shall overtake	171.6334
let the man go dartagnan let us save the	173.4191
monsieur	185.0368
eh monsieur	4458.3096
friend said dartagnan a halfpistole for that	390.8591
my faith monsieur with great	308.6931
here it	17.1282
the hostler enchanted with the good days work he had done returned to the	1621.3333
dartagnan unfolded the	3746.8511
eagerly demanded all his three	425.3867
nothing but one	147.4615
said	20.7309
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or	313.5677
armentires read porthos	47795.0000
i dont know such a	418.6471
and that name of a town or village is written in her	503.3224
cried	36.8714
come on come	17.1698
said dartagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my	1125.1874
to horse my friends to	51.2290
and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to	1132.5409
chapter	323.6512
it was thus with	781.1514
she escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at boulogne without	5311.6040
milady had likewise the best of passportsher beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her	1635.6960
monseigneur let your eminence be	550.2965
his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for	774.6700
milady de boulogne evening of the	1984.0955
accordingly that same evening milady commenced her	2702.6511
night overtook her she stopped and slept at an	529.7876
at five oclock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered	472.4186
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither	1907.3782
the superior met her milady showed her the cardinals	1905.7917
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast	3786.0029
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a	1860.9359
milady wished to please the	2361.0662
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she	411.1096
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a	2085.1973
but she was greatly	604.1329
daiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay	28944.9609
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and	20612.8926
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my	1411.3651
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at	2144.8440
she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his	998.7430
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or	288134.9375
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than	7230.3145
milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and	1850.8290
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the	1232.2578
one of your	18164.7227
said milady oh my	1111.0820
poor	3884.6665
i pity her	70.1925
and you have reason for she is much to be	278.9428
imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has suffered	35162.7305
said milady to herself who	1979.8568
i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the	380.1285
she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect	731.1780
alas said milady i know it is	117.9580
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is	1101.1221
the cardinal pursues not only crimes said she there are certain virtues which he pursues more severely than certain	4982.3911
permit me madame to express my surprise said the	1252.5693
at	223.8638
said milady with the utmost	17879.4727
at the language you	400.0016
what do you find so astonishing in that	482.1809
said milady	681.7291
at least you dont speak well of	187.6250
that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his	362.2626
but this letter in which he recommends you to	234.2831
but why have you not	172.9000
whither should i	74.1714
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman	426.7664
this young boarder of yours has she tried to	3219.6296
no that is true but shethat is another thing i believe she is detained in france by some love	628.1503
ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether	453.2369
then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor	4157.5400
alas yes said	640.6278
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her	1199.5431
you are not an enemy of our holy	1011.6016
said she	116.2417
cried milady i a	9103.0391
oh	217.1148
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent	1088.5132
she is amiable and	1572.8887
what is her	64.6559
she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of	859.2584
i have not tried to discover her other	362.7173
cried	8885.9863
are you	72.4282
that she is called	181.5113
yes	108.3246
do you know	25.2352
milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old	867.4089
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a	694.7482
asked	8885.9863
why this evening said the abbess today	3132.5706
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me	318.8452
this morning you rose at five oclock you must stand in need of	572.3895
go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse	3935.6450
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her	1146.4248
she had succeeded dartagnan was then in her	313.8484
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell	3409.0847
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her	482.3509
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to	298.4583
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic	1927.2887
the abbess introduced them to each	2131.7766
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women	874.3730
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but milady stopped	1075.4829
no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are	819.2468
well said milady what can those who sleep wish fora happy	7811.8345
the novice sat	600688.0000
how unfortunate i	561.7662
said she i have been here six months without the shadow of	559.2389
how you are going	43.0747
asked	8885.9863
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to	781.9661
said milady let us not even here speak thus of	287.4960
are you also the victim of a	347.9753
and who has abandoned youis that	266.1877
hear me said the novice we must trust in	1264.1143
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible	1494.2975
trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in	656.6271
said milady i believe so the queen is so	297.1621
oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her	259.4558
cried the novice with	10136.9531
i am acquainted with monsieur de putange i met monsieur dujart in england i know monsieur de	1648.5405
monsieur de	156.0836
exclaimed the novice do you know monsieur de	884.2332
yes perfectly wellintimately	587020.5000
the captain of the kings	71.0338
the captain of the kings	71.0338
why then only	127.5777
cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost	939.4445
if you know monsieur de trville you must have visited	245.8721
said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the	1034.1461
with him then you must have seen some of his	191.0207
all those he is in the habit of	267.4922
replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real	1294.6517
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my	202.5660
said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de	4637.7881
the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said dont you know a gentleman named	1477.1956
what is the	21.4165
good	866.8788
asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded	116.9439
oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and	423.7713
you know them	598.8176
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her	1563.2894
well if you know them you know that they are good and free	186.8501
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of	278.1818
that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of	368.8821
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur dartagnan say a great deal about	693.0846
you know monsieur	112.0986
cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her	731.7346
then remarking the strange expression of miladys countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what	804.6096
why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of	986.2557
you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his	995.5264
it is you who have been his mistress	215.9793
cried milady in her	311.0287
said the	87533.9219
yes	98.4007
i know you	30.3812
you are madame	382.1841
the young woman drew back filled with surprise and	918.2014
oh do not deny	166.1818
continued	8885.9863
well yes madame said the novice are we	3810.9075
the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances	1902.2401
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by	596.2263
speak	108.3244
resumed	325.5350
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed	562.4539
have you been or are you his	230.5307
oh	217.1148
cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	639.8051
never	1638.7281
i believe you said	142.9262
bonacieux but why then did you cry out	432.8386
do you not	37.7074
said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of	1070.2096
how can i	29.9021
i know	49.0157
can you not understand that monsieur dartagnan being my friend might take me into his	387.0505
do you not perceive that i know allyour abduction from the little house at	1083.5516
germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this	362.5142
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at	413.9649
and milady stretched out her arms to	378.4850
oh pardon me pardon	7.6033
cried she sinking upon the shoulders of	734.7205
pardon me i love him so	84.5405
these two women held each other for an instant in a close	1194.3914
certainly if miladys strength had been equal to her hatred	1662.2992
bonacieux would never have left that embrace	619.4391
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon	1308.6422
oh you beautiful good little	323.2796
said	8885.9863
how delighted i am to have found	119.4364
let me look at	241.0878
and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her	1208.2164
oh yes it is you	98.9582
from what he has told me i know you	71.0173
i recognize you	355.4823
then you know what i have suffered said	165.0822
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is	221.0508
milady replied mechanically yes that is	761.1122
she was thinking of something	305.3057
and then continued	52.1083
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a	400.4111
tomorrow this evening perhaps i shall see him again and then the past will no longer	309.7581
this	10207.6445
asked milady roused from her reverie by these	2258.0085
what do you	8.0716
do you expect news from	755.1788
i expect	789.6124
dartagnan	1715.3615
but thats	43.4508
he is at the siege of la rochelle with the	469.1879
he will not return till after the taking of the	342.5302
ah you fancy	151.3441
but is there anything impossible for my dartagnan the noble and loyal	527.1415
oh i cannot believe	62.1488
well read	72.0124
said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to	583.7791
the writing of madame de	1282.5796
said milady to	276.3877
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that	514.3265
and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself	2163.8794
prepare then for your departure and never despair of	385.6662
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as	1253.7931
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has	1233.6676
yes yes said milady the letter is	764.7243
do you know what that warning	163.1117
no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the	1931.0216
yes thats it no	161.5863
said milady returning the letter to	590.6835
bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her	1348.7764
at that moment they heard the gallop of a	138.4745
cried	325.5350
bonacieux darting to the window can it be	351.5528
he	71.5366
murmured she can it be	87.6856
and she remained in bed with her eyes	109.0196
alas	217.1148
said	325.5350
bonacieux it is a man i dont know although he seems to be coming	339.6633
yes he checks his pace he stops at the gate he	2292.0757
milady sprang out of	97.5299
you are sure it is not	85.3007
said	437.7391
yes yes very	159.3260
perhaps you did not see	87.1516
oh if i were to see the plume of his hat the end of his cloak i should know	328.7033
milady was dressing herself all the	927.5181
yes he has	61.8195
it is for you or	193.1488
my god how agitated you	1679.1180
yes i admit	72.8187
i have not your confidence i fear the	158.3655
said	325.5350
bonacieux somebody is	267.6587
immediately the door opened and the superior	89.2653
did you come from	626.0936
demanded she of	767.5175
yes replied she trying to recover her	1367.9413
who wants	98.2636
a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the	354.2312
and who wishes to speak with	249.1772
who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from	1918.0254
then let him come in if you	91.4200
oh my god my	26.5772
cried	325.5350
can it be bad	403.3580
i fear	249.2179
permit	98.4007
i beseech	43.5016
the superior and	1103.5548
bonacieux	2143.6724
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the	114.9893
milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefortthe demoniacal tool of his	1621.7593
chapter	95.3954
two varieties of demons ah cried milady and rochefort together it is	1888.6898
yes it is	14.9281
and you	31.5291
asked	8885.9863
from la rochelle and	74.2577
from	15479.8584
dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of	4927.4448
a fanatic has just assassinated	2220.5476
ah said rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chanceone that will delight his	822.7777
have you informed him of	220.2953
i wrote to him from	489.3505
but what brings you	87.6207
his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find	317.8142
i only arrived	848.9186
and what have you been doing since	211.5264
i have not lost my	221.3410
oh i dont doubt	71.0869
do you know whom i have encountered	323.7799
how can	14.7185
that young woman whom the queen took out of	742.8677
the mistress of that fellow	810.0391
yes madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was	1445.0503
well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the	568.7470
monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged	1444.1472
imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this	894.0938
does she know	23.6772
then she looks upon you as a	423.1364
milady	121.6219
i am her best	676.5032
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such	871.2533
and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on	250.1995
they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the	211.9366
and	5255.2969
dartagnan and his	34.3175
indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the	306.8229
why is it not done	90.6276
what would	11.1035
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i cannot	765.5383
well then tell him this	472.6579
but these four men must be now at the siege of la	522.3675
the	153.4100
whats to be	20.6106
what did the cardinal say about	265.8255
i must then remain	305.6371
here or in the	224.0198
you cannot take me with	75.6968
no the order is	894.9042
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the	407.7715
then i must wait here or in the	233.6298
observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain	209.4949
you forget that my enemies may arrive at any	1757.8883
thats true but is this little woman then to escape his	448.3301
said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best	803.3854
ah thats	26.2033
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at	316.1531
is that	38.3689
he will know what that	157.0443
he will guess at	323.0605
now then what had i better	115.7351
return	38052.1484
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little	607.8878
my chaise broke down coming into	31707.3730
what	32201.4395
yes i want your	3561.9158

i have my full	506.3776
very	244.6467
dont forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the	1279.6687
to what	49.7571
i am a victim of the	153.1967
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame	568.4198
thats	672.4240
now will you make me a report of all that has	328.6274

and you say you will wait for me at	313.6792
at	549789312.0000

there is nothing compromising in the name of a	409.5969
is it not	23.6529
eh who	45.6873
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper i will compromise	1025.5540
i will do as children do for fear of losing the paperrepeat the name along the	1105.0181
now is that	27.4354
i believe	5.0661

in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of	372.3326
a propos add one thing	2284.7080
i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent	2056.8943
say that i am permitted to walk in those	905.0283
who	13.3428
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for	507.0509
you think of	345.3378
and you forget one	195.8569
to ask me if i want	142.6585
thats	672.4240
how much do you	62.2246

commend me to	5673.1641
milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and	195.6887
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through	2868.3235
chapter	194.6429
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when	2145.6338
bonacieux	27591.7012
she found milady with a smiling	901.1660
well said the young woman what you dreaded has	212.6834
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you	251.0003
who told you that my	118.2999
asked	8885.9863
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger	216.2248
come and sit down close to me said	507.7516
here i	27.9237
wait till i assure myself that nobody hears	1719.1470
why all these	219.6566
you shall	29.7289
then said she he has well played his	239.7062
who	123.0056
he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the	784.1082
it was then a part he was	400.5310
yes my	31.2452
that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my	391.8259
your	38389.6016
cried	325.5350
no one must know this secret my dear but	286.6171
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself	429.3273
oh my	21.0990
he followed	24.4711
the messenger resisted my brother killed	2501.0234
said	325.5350
bonacieux	2674.8403
remember that was the only	159.9258
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for	3060.0454
i	1108.5546
it is your brother who sends this	423.8897
exactly but that is not	38.2132
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse	278.0526
it is a	213.0381
how can that	44.6047
yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch	756.6220
but it is dartagnan that will	66.6290
do not deceive	1011.6768
dartagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la	671.8423
how do you know	15.1591
my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of	665.8953
oh my	21.0990
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of	44378.5664
i feel if this continues said	4644.3735
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go	384.4075
stop	223.8638
i hear a horses steps it is my brother setting off	1512.9597
i should like to offer him a last	716.2450
milady opened the window and made a sign to	238.5292
bonacieux to join	548.4418
the young woman	2137.9282
rochefort passed at a	483.5345
adieu	38389.6016
cried	8885.9863
the good	52584.6797
said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and	678.7861
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely	1431.7688
dear lady said	374.2525
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to	199.1331
good	242.3603
you have more experience than i	170.2068
speak i will	69.5466
oh that would be too	78.7378
cried	325.5350
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for	397.9892
then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive	487.9217
oh yes yes lost beyond	19025.6836
what then to	43.0170
what to	181.2425
there would be a very simple means very natural tell me	826.7849
to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for	378.0919
but where can i	78.4601
oh there is no difficulty in	70.0052
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin	2110.6421
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait	514.9396
but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a	300.7660
but	20.7309
if he	166.2498
shall we not know	56.8425
nothing	616437.1875
we will send my brothers servant back to bthune whom as i told you we can	837.9652
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the	580.6220
he knows them	122.8098

oh yes yes you are	154.1704

seven or eight leagues at the	711.2800
we will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave	855.5355

excellent thank	13.4696
and the two women parted exchanging charming	9565.3105
milady had told the truthher head was confused for her illarranged plans clashed one another like	13132.5996
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into	529.3268
what was most pressing was to get	589.7897
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a	762.4567
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep	368.9400
bonacieux in her	1928.2236
bonacieux was the very life of	104.2520
now this point was settled	1197.5056
bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied	4234.1660
she would not be weary thank	840.8916
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her characterperfecting a beautiful	4318.9131
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was	260.0100
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup	2143.6416
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the	279.2594
milady	264290.2500
do you hear	60.3552
said	437.7391
yes the rolling of a	173.9807
it is the one my brother sends for	178.8435

the bell of the convent gate was sounded milady was not	2105.7002

we will snatch some supper we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength	700.1842
great	866.8788
said	325.5350
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i cannot	1956.9110
courage	5275.6948
yes yes everything for	433.2820
you have restored my courage by a single word go i will rejoin	648.4752
milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found rocheforts lackey and gave him his	1870.7412
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on	1329.2593
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of	1671.9841
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed	729.2122
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away	444.3669
milady asked some questions about the	575.3558
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion rocheforts lackey would precede it as	7914.4175
milady was wrong in fearing that	818.7607
bonacieux would have any	250.3932
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is	325.2397
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the	1298.5183
yes said	47.4232
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be	908.5640
see said she if everything does not second	285.6077
here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we	1272.4031
come	5275.6948
take	13249.7949
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her	1122.3842
come	849.0659
said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i	2717.0522
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid	2053.6328
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw	928.0012
oh my	21.0990
said	325.5350
bonacieux what is that	67.4813
that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible	992.3283
stay where you are i will tell	45.5168
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a	548.4478
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces	1813.7744
if they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an	475.2789
the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their	1876.1628
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	410.1492
milady uttered a stifled	599.9362
in the first horseman she recognized	1269.1454
oh my god my god cried	85.6030
bonacieux what is	13.6692
it is the uniform of the cardinals	255.1275
not an instant to be	114.3568
fly	6388.4570
yes yes let us	134.4181
repeated	325.5350
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by	513.0313
they heard the horsemen pass under the	494.8561
come then come	12.9626
cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the	1230.1179
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make	1208.5459
in five minutes it will be too	449.9185
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her	948.7859
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do	538.4845
then three or four shots were	342.7038
for the last time will you	111.1827
cried	8885.9863
oh my god my	26.5772
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i cannot	358.9354
flee	1860.2173
flee alone and leave you	58.6896
no no	156.4521
cried	8885.9863
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into	1009.0295
bonacieuxs glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular	649.9528
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved	1523.8259
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said	485.2160
this wine will give you strength	275.1566
and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank	290.9729
we do what we	23.9022
and she rushed out of the	78.4425
a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the	375.9233
every instant	132.5328
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not	450.0414
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning	623.1019
cried she is it	29.6824
this	1144.4231
this	1144.4231
replied the young man where are	103.6516
where are	7.8678
my	15.9808
bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of	2087.3408
dartagnan threw down a yetsmoking pistol which he held in his hand and fell on his knees before his	900.9958
oh dartagnan my beloved	281.4174
you have come then at	107.7152
you have not deceived	135.2718

i was not willing to	214.7670
oh i have done	35.8880
how happy i	404.1533
at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started	714.5394
what	437.7387
asked	20.7309
why my	294.0132
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my	719.7721
she who mistaking you for the cardinals guards has just fled	956.0900
your	962832.3750
cried dartagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his	589.3964
of what companion are you speaking dear	1336.6895
her name her	18.2407
cried	20.7309
my god can you not remember her	371.0313

stopbutit is very strangeoh my god my head	2049.2466

her hands are icy cold cried	3655.8691
she is	175.1964
great god she is losing her	793.6768
said athos oh no it is	250.2941
god would not permit such a	286.6977
water	230139.7969
cried	20.7309
oh poor woman poor	82.9157
murmured athos in a broken	193.6893
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of	290.1956
she	363406592.0000
cried the young	27.7476
oh my god my god i thank	38.8211
said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is	325.1827
mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying	243.7423
but who poured the wine for you that was in this	263.0643
but who is	35.8685
oh i	40.5335
said	325.5350
bonacieux the comtesse de	1808.7633
the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the	844.5547
at that moment the countenance of	313.6621
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and	1048.1725
dartagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be	842.1391
and what do you	34.1662
his voice was stifled by	382.4767
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid	1701.5800
dartagnan	20.7309
cried	325.5350
bonacieux where art	14.0208
do not leave	97.4732
you see i am	72.1941
dartagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to	299.1917
in the name of heaven run	403.7777
call for	346.8109
said athos	766.8279
for the poison which she pours there is no	4026.3452
yes	339.7200
help	3922.4558
murmured	325.5350
bonacieux	3922.4558
constance	3638421.2500
cried	20.7309
a sigh escaped from the mouth of	512.5034
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of	277.9359
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to	2324.9233
dartagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his	533.8397
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the	1014.3901
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the	414.4788
he looked around him and saw	228.0287
bonacieux dead and dartagnan in a	308.3540
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great	1682.3655
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur dartagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and	407.0102
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with	954.4652
it seemed to all three that they knew	196.3670
i am lord de winter brotherinlaw of that	568.4702
the three friends uttered a cry of	222.4526
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of	470.0534
i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de	673.7810
i arrived three hours after her at	224.7606
i missed her by twenty minutes at	462.9606
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of	1807.6578
i was going about at random inquiring of everybody when i saw you gallop	1051.1746
i recognized monsieur	201.0854
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too	924.9592
you	850.9105
said athos pointing to	213.4655
bonacieux dead and to dartagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to	1146.5829
are they both	1173.6809
asked lord de winter	583.5319
no replied athos fortunately monsieur dartagnan has only	789.7472
ah indeed so much the	60.8528
said lord de	38.0619
at that moment dartagnan opened his	143.0013
women weep for the dead men avenge	1247.7295
oh	339.7200
cried dartagnan	254.7736
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow	226.3765
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in	607.8411
treat her as one of your	1173.0308
we will return someday to pray over her	4755.0605
dartagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed	789.0331
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and	842.4897
alas would i could weep like	258.0045
but said dartagnan shall we not pursue that	305.5674
later said	13.2381
i have measures to	2120.5999
she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault	255.7643
i will be accountable for her said	964.9529
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of	1096.2148
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of	1320.7518
dartagnan needs to be alone to weep and to	420.5346
i take charge of everything be	1018.8864
and me said athos she is my	182.7602
dartagnan smiledfor he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a	1124.0714
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew	78.2460
lord de winter thought athos was	549.1534
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to	681.2466
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns	473.7254
that name written in her	547.6891
you see then said athos there is a god in heaven	272.9753
chapter	107.7134
planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from	1361.4113
they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to armentireseach by a different	1674.1038
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew milady	939.9832
all four were to meet the next day at eleven	268.9596
these arrangements made the lackeys	3841.9507
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the	868.6635
it was nearly ten	84.2614
at ten oclock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little	1417.5938
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a	2048.7200
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to	1298.5376
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by	808.3159
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man	474.6545
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood	1393.9819
in a few minutes a night watch	391.7691
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he	222.7790
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third	513.2280
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and	838.7355
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was	1019.4122
it was dark and silent as the	300.0922
three times athos knocked without receiving an	5923.9800
at the third knock however steps were heard	1950.3956
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and	673.2392
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind	274.2790
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the	515.9995
there was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this	752.8920
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of	222.3700
athos required no	62.6182
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came reentered the htel and went to his	195.9033
at daybreak dartagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be	438.4667
to wait replied	189.6161
as to the key it had	164.1012
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was	3104.7175
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the	825.9648
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the	537.1866
everything was as athos had	559.6927
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the	1058.3734
the man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her	553.8430
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found	551.8666
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles and from fromelles she had set out for	3081.4377
planchet took the crossroad and by seven oclock in the morning he was at	1290.2626
there was but one tavern the	222.4850
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a	258.7258
planchet had no need to learn	165.5826
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of	1412.4053
what is to be	24.7542
asked	20.7309
to	1702.9525
replied	36.8714
each retired to his own	408.0480
in an instant all five were	689.9997
each examined his arms and put them in	227.1781
athos came down last and found dartagnan already on horseback and growing	610.5205
cried athos one of our party is still	562.7238
at this moment planchet brought out athoss horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the	6571.2954
wait for me cried he i will soon be back and he set off at a	412.7117
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another	452.3595
at nine oclock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had	3595.4919
chapter	69.2341
he had but one thoughtto go forward and he	956.3130
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the	1626.2764
the cavalcade trotted on more	67743.6875
a little before they came to fromelles the storm	1792.5415
they spread their	7512.6465
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of	4323.6191
dartagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his	607.1859
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish	3394.9812
athos recognized	903.0617
whats the	828.9213
cried	36.8714
has she left	20057.5625
grimaud made a sign in the	116.7170
dartagnan ground his	343.7927
silence	20.7309
said	36.8714
i have charged myself with this	396.0348
it is for me then to interrogate	264.6971
where is	31.4857
asked	36.8714
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the	166.4779
far from	76.3584
asked	36.8714
grimaud showed his master his forefinger	3078.5535
asked	36.8714
grimaud made the sign	132.0185
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the	431.9994
thats well said	18.8235
lead us	48.8555
grimaud took his course across the country and acted as guide to the	814.0013
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they	1899.7410
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of	760.1029
is she there	176.1935
asked	36.8714
grimaud shook his head	1595.3468
silence	76.0789
cried	36.8714
and the troop continued their	1023.1395
another flash illuminated all around	12307.0635
one window was	733.5803
here we	40.6278
said	36.8714
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards	493.9539
it was	167.3056
he pointed his finger to the lighted	438.6855
she is there said	32.6921
and	27531.7441
asked	36.8714
while i watched the window he guarded the	186.0561
said	36.8714
you are good and faithful	277.8447
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet	3814.6309
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	1097.7092
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of	692.6877
he was not deceived it was she whom he	144.4047
at this moment a horse	820.7867
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and	730.8148
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and	472.3607
the window	646.0668
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the	2330.9512
milady rushed to the door and opened	59.2026
more pale and menacing than athos dartagnan stood on the	257.0065
milady recoiled uttering a	6222.9429
put back that weapon	775.3538
said he this woman must be tried not	513.3521
wait an instant my friend and you shall be	198.3092
come in	397.7033
dartagnan obeyed for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord	590.5754
behind dartagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red	435.6067
the four lackeys guarded the door and the	421.2660
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible	1182.1239
perceiving her brotherinlaw she uttered a terrible	753.3115
what do you	22.7201
screamed	8885.9863
that is	21.6214
that is	21.6214
murmured milady in extreme terror what do you	858.5596
we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend	335.3706
justify yourself if you	93.7949
dartagnan it is for you to accuse her	154.3242
dartagnan	30050.1562
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday	1271.0586
he turned towards porthos and	90.0968
we bear witness to this said the two musketeers with one	351.1052
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my	1716.8164
we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as	297.5692
i have	53.0908
and dartagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and	156.6338

the baron came	1002.1577
the duke of buckingham	2177.6970
cried all present with one	188.7299
yes said the baron	686.2309
she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the	746.8717
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this	466.3365
a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown	1109.4230
that is not all resumed lord de	290.3455
my sister how did your husband	651.9507
cried porthos and	27.0649
and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of dartagnan leaving the place free for another	1759.9624
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal	1268.5621
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpentmy	1088.9005
oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against	2220.9194
i defy you to find him who executed	382.6821
said a hollow	384.2495
it is for me to reply to	80.1882
and the man in the red cloak came forward in his	362.9177
what man is	23.0092
what man is	23.0092
cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if	4669.8140
all eyes were turned towards this manfor to all except athos he was	1031.7460
then she suddenly cried oh no	429.4131
rising and retreating to the very	142.5273
no	13.0559
it is an infernal	1325.5457
it is not	14.8282
help	3922.4558
screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her	484.1358
who are you	25.4507
cried all the witnesses of this	230.8799
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows	405.5972
the executioner of lille the executioner of	7711.8979
cried milady a prey to insensate terror and clinging with her hands to the wall to avoid	2333.5679
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the	223.8289
oh grace grace	99433.8516
cried the wretch falling on her	84.1807
the unknown waited for silence and then resumed i told you well that she would know	444.0422
yes i am the executioner of lille and this is my	412.3805
all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious	700.4280
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is	462.0363
she was a nun in the convent of the benedictines of	1623.8672
a young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that	1014.9615
she undertook his seduction and succeeded she would have seduced a	3074.5486
their vows were sacred and	5184.3315
their connection could not last long without ruining	8233.2803
neither had	59.0604
eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and	887.6928
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be	1846.8600
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has	703.7551
i was obliged to brand the guilty one and he gentlemen was my	560.6080
i suspected where she was	551.6584
my poor brother was ignorant of this	569.7573
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little	4519.9316
this woman passed for his	1579.9305
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their	615.5014
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at	680.7027
that is the crime of which i accuse her that is the cause for which she was	326.7072
monsieur dartagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this	405.7545
the punishment of death replied	499.3994
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this	711.6053
the punishment of death replied lord de	423.7145
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this	659.8214
the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow	553.5620
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her	3035.9280
athos stretched out his hand toward	85.8736
if you know a prayer say itfor you are condemned and you shall	1576.2366
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the	867.9058
lord de winter dartagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind	269.9793
chapter	226.6789
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy	1526.0466
a deathlike silence oppressed all	45779.6992
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one	1713.5710
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter dartagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the	693.5150
planchet and bazin came	212.5332
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the	1307.0538
grimaud	2601.1736
mousqueton trembled in all his	952.7518
athos who heard miladys voice came sharply	3977.2061
lord de winter did the	469.6725
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to	540.0737
they are no longer	34.8522
planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and	373.9162
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and	805.2222
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassinsten men combined to murder one	4563.6479
if i am not saved i shall be	487.1638
you are not a woman said athos coldly and	522.1013
ah you virtuous	1627.1311
said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an	620.2776
this is the last judge that is	104.8417
nachrichter as say our neighbors the	2310.7666
you are not	135.6198
you cannot condemn	1001.6375
i offered you tyburn said lord de	1712.3973
why did you not accept	96.8525
because i am not willing to	319.6954
cried milady	5389.9165
because i am too young to	116.9566
the woman you poisoned at bthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said	814.3745
i will enter a cloister i will become a nun said	2473.8936
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my	689.8250
milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her	461.0268
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the	258.4913
oh my	21.0990
cried she my	52.8729
are you going to drown	660.7672
these cries had something so heartrending in them that	1085.8708
dartagnan was the youngest of all these	1041.2079
his heart failed	289.8710
oh i cannot behold this frightful	2324.6331
said	71.5366
i cannot consent that this woman should die	673.0688
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of	736.0495
dartagnan	20.7309
cried she remember that i loved	173.2897
the young man rose and took a step toward	210.0727
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the	440.9200
if you take one step farther dartagnan said he we shall cross swords	620.4250
dartagnan sank on his knees and	154.7135
come continued athos executioner do your	642.2023
thats	244.6467
athos made a step toward	753.8142
i pardon you said he the ill you have done	133.5148
die in	4017.2898
lord de winter advanced in his	353.9962
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord	438.6731
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own	502.3669

and i said	32.3531
i pardon you and i weep for	153.1931
die in	4017.2898
i am	93.7935
murmured milady in	880.8301
i must	20.7961
she saw nothing she listened and she heard	385.5546
where am i to	52.4593
said	437.7391
on the other bank replied the	516.1439
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as	339.0193
and he threw the money into the	195.7685
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her	1904.3883
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to	1185.4600
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her	894.8948
and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over	449.9082
de	257.5922
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your	886.5524
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his	172.5124
chapter	38.7528
arrived and was the bearer of the dukes dying gift to the	263.8040
the joy of the king was	223.9722
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the	2478.2668
louis	973.8572
like every weak mind was wanting in	1058.5304
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain	733.2040
he felt that in returning to camp he should reenter slavery nevertheless he did	3172.5537
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly	1004.4867
our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads	2400.2852
holloa monsieur	15.7094
said he is not that you whom i see	92.9476
dartagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of	200.5388
dartagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the	76.5285
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet	490.5008
ah	185.0368
said the young man i meet you then at	163.6571
this time you shall not escape	125.1710
what do you	23.7790
cried	20.7309
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without	313.7539
this concerns your head i warn	2911.6001
who are you	25.4507
demanded dartagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering	982.8755
i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into	409.3534
you have my word monsieur and here is my	243.2667
this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my	1142.8521
if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find	525.6377
what has become of her	189.9903
asked rochefort	1067.6270
return to camp and you shall	172.6469
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his	712.0256
they resumed their	1221.6636
on the morrow at three oclock in the afternoon they arrived at	381.2216
the cardinal there awaited louis	2904.7634
dartagnan	138.4321
we shall wait for you dartagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear	194.7992
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single	748.7759
dartagnan entered after the cardinal and behind dartagnan the door was	220.8530
rochefort obeyed and	81.4301
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and	565.1898
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my	174.9435
so they tell me	221.8417
do you know	22.5771
no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your	374.3135
richelieu looked steadfastly at the young	97.3050
said he what does that	42.5171
crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the	1814.6792
what	429.0064
said dartagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal	422.6073
and who charges me with this	510.8677
what do you say	19.6777
cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking	174.6089
she has been punished	1608.9606
and who has punished	204.3365
she is in	113.8936
she is	33.8533
repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard	285.2993
did you not say she was	89.0104
three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i	1129.6305
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned	298.2586
dartagnan then related the poisoning of	819.4719
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder	759.7699
monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against	221.1784
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon	1610.7531
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of	372.0672
another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his	405.8541
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am	669.1939
your	4520.0566
said richelieu	332.5802
yes monseigneur said	249.2003
and signed by whomby the	7612.3970
and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of	527.9612
no by your	127.5639
by	130.0698
you are insane	13721.3408
monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own	2081.0967
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable	3066.3408
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to	568.1894
well my	150.9473
he shall see how a gentleman can	697.3251
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die	3242.4375
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his	2957.6924
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified	749.5928
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous	1338.5131
richelieu slowly tore the paper which dartagnan had generously	1662.5402
i am	93.7935
said dartagnan to	40.6799
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be	819.6368
thats very kind of	449.6483
here monsieur said the cardinal to the young	61.0354
i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you	1566.3778
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it	657.3875
dartagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenants commission in the	629.8438
dartagnan fell at the feet of the	161.2854
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of	323.9578
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not	499.9936
i shall never forget it replied	190.1583
your eminence may be certain of	259.5320
the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice	326.0585
the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered	669.4895
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur	109.0861
i receive him among the number of my	477.1348
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your	552.7515
they left the chamber at the same	85.7414
we shall meet again shall we not	357.9198
when you please said	40.6023
an opportunity will come replied	763.2092
said the cardinal opening the	28.3946
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his	714.5479
we were beginning to grow impatient said	1297.3047
here i am my friends replied dartagnan not only free but in	211.8942
tell us about	106.1301
this evening but for the moment let us	205.0431
athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive	816.9379
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fre it is too	410.2341
keep the commission it is	358.5789
you have purchased it dearly	2452.7581
dartagnan left athoss chamber and went to that of	294.0535
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a	2585.0056
ah	213.9960
is that you dear	30.3329
exclaimed	24.6358
how do you think these garments fit	1246.8225
wonderfully said dartagnan but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still	290.3412
asked	24.6358
that of a lieutenant of	222.4152
porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to dartagnan to the great astonishment of the young	190.2140
look	1715.3615
i was trying on my wedding	1424.7635
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep	862.3163
the young man then entered the apartment of	232.7821
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer	2541.8665
alas dear	14.5320
said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military	3567.3381
this time my determination is irrevocably	2803.7004
after the siege i shall enter the house of the	1122.9720
keep the commission dartagnan the profession of arms suits	1410.4299
you will be a brave and adventurous	886.4061
well said he they likewise have refused	301.4404
that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than	493.3562
he took a quill wrote the name of dartagnan in the commission and returned it to	441.9763
i shall then have no more friends said the young	224.2074
nothing but bitter	6381.0405
and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his	719.9615
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet	1518.8342
on the twentyeighth of october the capitulation was	4463.3291
the king made his entrance into paris on the twentythird of december of the same	1163.6597
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not	1146.6938
he entered by the faubourg	157.9144
jacques under verdant	1036148.2500
dartagnan took possession of his	447.8596
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married	374.3851
coquenard the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand	3788.3833
bazin became a lay	1197.2653
grimaud followed	59.6529
dartagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three	1184.8174
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to	389.5479
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded	302.3421
they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any	16880.0977
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont	1935.7390
